the_metro;The Metro;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
the_metro_desc;Rapid transit began with the opening in 1863 of the Metropolitan Railway, now part of the London Underground. Rapid transit evolved from steam railways during the late 19th century. In 1890 the City & South London Railway in London was the first electric rapid transit railway. The electric railway eventually was merged into London Underground. The technology swiftly spread to other cities in Europe, as in Budapest, Hungary in 1896, and then to the United States. A number of elevated systems were built, starting with the 1893 100% designed electric Liverpool Overhead Railway, which also had a small underground section complete with station. The elevated railways in Chicago and New York were converted to electric from steam propulsion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
skyscrapers;Skyscraper Architecture;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
skyscrapers_desc;Modern skyscrapers are built with steel or reinforced concrete frameworks and curtain walls of glass or polished stone. They utilize mechanical equipment such as water pumps and elevators. Until the 19th century, buildings of over six storeys were rare, as having great numbers of stairs to climb was impractical for inhabitants, and water pressure was usually insufficient to supply running water above 50 m (164 ft). Most early skyscrapers emerged in the land-strapped areas of Chicago, London, and New York toward the end of the 19th century. A land boom in Melbourne, Australia between 1888â€“1891 spurred the creation of a significant number of early skyscrapers, though none of these were steel reinforced and few remain today.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
social_engineering;Social Engineering;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
social_engineering_desc;Social engineering is a discipline in social science that refers to efforts to influence popular attitudes and social behaviors on a large scale, whether by governments or private groups. In the political arena, the counterpart of social engineering is political engineering. Virtually all law and governance has the effect of seeking to change behavior and could be considered ''social engineering'' to some extent. Governments also influence behavior more subtly through incentives and disincentives built into economic policy and tax policy, for instance, and have done so for centuries.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
technocracy;Technocracy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
technocracy_desc;Technocracy is a form of government in which experts in technology would be in control of all decision making. Scientists, engineers, and technologists who have knowledge, expertise, or skills, would compose the governing body, instead of politicians, businessmen, and economists. In a technocracy, decision makers would be selected based upon how knowledgeable and skillful they are in their field. The term technocracy was originally used to designate the application of the scientific method to solving social problems, in counter distinction to the traditional economic, political, or philosophic approaches.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
roaring_twenties;Roaring Twenties;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
roaring_twenties_desc;The Roaring Twenties is a term sometimes used to refer to the 1920s, characterizing the era's distinctive cultural edge in most of the world's major cities for a period of sustained economic prosperity. ''Normalcy'' returned to politics in the wake of hyper-emotional patriotism during World War I, jazz music blossomed, the flapper redefined modern womanhood, and Art Deco peaked. Economically, the era saw the large-scale diffusion and use of automobiles, telephones, motion pictures, and electricity, unprecedented industrial growth, accelerated consumer demand and aspirations, and significant changes in lifestyle and culture. Finally the Wall Street Crash of 1929 ended the era, as the Great Depression set in worldwide, bringing years of worldwide gloom and hardship.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
art_deco;Art Deco;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
art_deco_desc;Art Deco is an influential visual arts design style which first appeared in France during the 1920s, flourished internationally during the 30s and 40s, then waned in the post-World War II era. It is an eclectic style that combines traditional craft motifs with Machine Age imagery and materials. The style is often characterized by rich colors, bold geometric shapes and lavish ornamentation. Deco emerged from the Interwar period when rapid industrialization was transforming culture. One of its major attributes is an embrace of technology. This distinguishes Deco from the organic motifs favored by its predecessor Art Nouveau.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

early_archaeology;Early Archaeology;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
early_archaeology_desc;Archaeology is the study of the activity of ancient civilizations, primarily through the recovery and analysis of the objects and records left behind, including artifacts, architecture, biofacts and cultural landscapes (the archaeological record). Organized study of human antiquity dates back to the days of the Renaissance, but in the 19th century archaeology evolved into a true science. Archaeologists began to investigate various ruins around the world, with the study of ancient Aegean civilization being stimulated by the excavations of Heinrich Schliemann at Troy and of Arthur Evans at Crete, while John Lloyd Stephens was a pivotal figure in the rediscovery of the Maya civilization throughout Central America. However, the methodologies employed by these early archaeologists were problematic by the standards of the 20th century.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
modern_archaeology;Modern Archaeology;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
modern_archaeology_desc;Archaeological field methods underwent further developments in the late 19th century. One of the leading figures in modern archaeology was Augustus Pitt Rivers, who meticulously excavated Cranborne Chase in southern England, emphasizing that not only items of beauty or value should be recorded, but mundane items as well. He thus helped to differentiate archaeology from mere antiquarianism. Flinders Petrie pioneered a new level of meticulousness in the examination and preservation of artifacts. Archaeologists---once nothing more than tomb raiders---became reputable scientists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;

Nevertheless, there may be still a chance to get a permission. Our diplomats were able to talk with some deputies, who would talk with the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ head of state.

EVTDESC201015;The last archaeological exhibition was not without it side effects. We were mocked as 'backward scientists'.

The leader, a man with three-day stubble and a bull-whip in his hand, gives a sign to rest for a while. Steles and rocks with engravings. The whole territory is marked by them. The archaeologist's eyes flit over stairs, destroyed and mossy. The ancient ruin of a Maya pyramid. He pricks up his ears, as one of the heavers raises his hand and shouts: 'Hombre, I think I found the entrance!';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201023;Our expedition has found an ancient Maya Pyramid in the middle of the jungle of Yucatan. And even more, our chief-archaeologist, RenÃ© Emile Belloq, was able to get a holy idol, which was coincidentally in the hand of a fedora-wearing american archaeologist. Unfortunately, this poor man was slained by savages of the local Hovito tribe, as Belloq affirms. Now, this wonderful idol will be our new tourist attraction in the Mesoamerican section of the Louvre!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201025;Expedition members eaten by Dinosaurs?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201025;The members of our last expedition in the unexplored jungles of Yucatan have returned without success. The survivors, emaciated, pale and littered with scars, have lost even their equipment and are happy that they were able to return. But the director of the Archaeological Museum rose his eyebrows, when they were forced to tell, what happened to the other team members, the heavers and the equipment. The leading archaeologists shouted like a maniac, made wild gesticulations and told, that they were lost in a hidden valley, in the middle of the jungle, unknown to anyone. In this valley, prehistoric animals like dinosaurs and other extinct creatures lived and attacked the expedition. He continued his fantastic story, becoming even more exaggerated, and was finally brought in a sanatory. We don't know what happened, but this man has clearly lost his mind. Now we must start from the scratch. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201026;El Mirador discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201026;Ruins in the jungle as far as the eye can reach. These remains are old - very old, as our archaeologists affirm. This huge city is one of the biggest places ever found in Yucatan, and it dates back to pre-classical times. El Mirador, one of the oldest and greatest settlements of the Mayan culture, was rediscovered by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologists.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201027;A Mayan Riddle;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201027;Footsteps resound in the hall. Light is rare, only a torch illuminates engraved walls. Silence. You go farther, through a corridor. Observing the plates on the ground, the roots of enormous trees, which break through the collapsed ceiling. An amazing place. You take a breath. A breath of history, which floatens this atmosphere. Then, after minutes of walking through mossy corridors, you find a monumental gate, decorated with faces and hieroglyphs. A short view in your book later, you are able to read what the Mayas wrote centuries ago on this wall. It's a riddle: 'The farmer needs it/ the capitalist loves it/ and builds even factories/ but you hate it./ If you stockpile the/ most useless good in/ the world you will/ uncover the truth.';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201028;The Idol;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201028;You fetch your bag with fertilizer. (Every $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologist has his bag with fertilizer with him, as everyone knows, because of the famous $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Fertilizer Decree, which enforces every archaeologist to take a bag of fertilizer with him, because nobody in the world wants to buy it and $COUNTRY$ searches ways to get rid of it.) In front of you stands an altar. Gold sparkles in the glimming light. An Mayan idol. A sceptical look to it. A look to the bag. You weigh the bag in your hand, estimating the weight of the idol. Fertilizer runs out of the bag. It is now lightier. You are waiting for the moment, staring at the idol, the bag with fertilizer in the left hand, your right hand on the head of the artefact.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201029;It's a trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201029;You are able to replace the idol. The bag of fertilizer lays on the altar. You look in the face of the strange idol, enjoying the beauty of Mayan art. Savouring this moment, only for a little while. Noises. Brutal, loud noises interrupt the scene. You look upward. Something has changed. The muffled noise becomes louder. Something is rolling. Something big. Very big. A gigantic stoneball!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201030;You escape through the corridors, the idol in your right hand, but the trap is triggered. A gigantic stoneball is rolling right behind you!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201031;An evil Frenchman;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201031;With a last jump you are able to reach the exit of the pyramid, landing in the grass of the jungle - and cornered by mesoamerican Indios. A voice with a soft french accent sounds in the near. A man in white clothes looks at you, amused by your escape. 'It is nice to meet you. But I think, this artefact should be in better hands than yours.' You are forced to surrender, as the heavers were killed by the tribe. 'Too bad the Hovitos don't know you the way I do' is your only response. Your are able to flee - but without the idol.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201032;Leaving the Pyramid;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201032;On your way out of the pyramid, you clatch at a root in the ceiling. The idol in the left, the root in the right, the stoneball rolls under your shoes, through the corridor, and crushs in the jungle. You slump down, following the devastation. As you reach the exit, you see smashed bodies of Indios, scattered spears and weapons. It seems, that someone prepared an ambush, which was dissolved by the huge ball. Not sure, what happened here, but now, that the expedition was a full success, it is time to return to $CAPITAL$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201033;An archive of cuneiform tablets;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201033;Clay tablets were used as writing medium in the ancient middle east. Imprinted cuneiform characters can give us a whole new viewing of the old times of Babylonia. Satisfyingly, our archaeologists have found a whole archive of old tablets on their last expedition. They believe, that this archive was part of a large palace of an unknown ruler.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201034;Sumerian palace found;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201034;Today is an exceptional day for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeology. After months of researchs and excavations, our team has found an old palace, dating back to sumerian times. Our archaeologists estimate, that this structures are over 5000 years old!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201035;Mesopotamian expedition failed;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201035;The archaeological team in Mesopotamia is in a bad crisis. It seems, that the place of research was miscalculated by the chief-archaeologists. In fact, they have searched for month at the false place, finding nothing and remaining only with dirt in their hands. That is a heavy setback for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeology.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201036;The Tower of Babel;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201036;Scientific research and aerial photos leave no doubt: Babylon, once a myth and known in the west only as a decadent city mentioned in the bible, is now a well known place of modern archaeology. The Hanging Gardens of Semiramis and a large palace were found and carefully examined. Archivs full of clay tablets were translated. But the most prestigious trove was the discovery by an $COUNTRY_ADJ$ archaeologist, who confirmed that even the legendary Tower of Babel is not a fable, but has historical roots. A large building was found, believed as the example for the story in the bible. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
inca_excavations_interrupted;Contact to expedition lost;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
inca_excavations_interrupted_desc;The communication between our expedition in Peru and our archaeological society is interupted. Until the war goes on, our enemies will try to disturb every information exchange.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201040;Preparations;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201040;The Andes are rough and dangerous. Our archaeologists should be well equipped before we send them in the mountains. A list of goods was made, which the expedition demands. We should prepare 1 airplane, 1 off-road vehicle, 2 units of canned food and 3 barrels of fuel.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201041;The expedition begins;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201041;The Peruvian sun scorches our skin. We have left Cusco one week ago, entering the endless lands of mountains. The majesty of the Andes is overwhelming, and the ravines deep like the gorges of hell. Henry, my fellow student from twenty years ago, has joined this journey to undiscovered lands. His nose and eyes are deepened in a book. 'So, this was the way they took?', he asks en passant. 'No wonder they got lost.' My only response is a nod. Henry is an experienced archaeologist, a high regarded personality. Unlike me, he was able to climb the career ladder. They say, that he would be able to find Alexander's tomb in a second, only wandering in it's near - when others dug for centuries, only excavating some old chicken bones. 'The aeroplane is ready', I mention, wiping the sweat from my eyebrows. It's the moment, when Henry puts his book away. 'Aeroplane?', sounds his voice sceptically, 'I don't like them. You know, I get sick in these darn machines. What about the car the government offered us?';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201042;An old bridge;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201042;I follow Henry's advice. I'm the official leader of this expedition, but I know Henry's aversion against these new technologies. When we began with our studies at the university, our professors put us for days in dirty holes, only equipped with a rusty shovel and outdated instruments. Now, everything has changed. The methods, the equipment. Even a car. 'That's a fine kind of travelling', Henry says, leaning in the cushioned seat beside me, viewing the panorama. Maybe I must correct myself - some technologies seem to please even Henry. But than, we are forced to make a stop. A river cuts the hills in front of us, and only an old bridge connects both sides. It is obvious that we can't go on the other side with our vehicle. The bridge seems in a bad condition, only made of ragged ropes. I look in Henry's direction. 'And now? What shall we do?';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201043;Crossing the bridge;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201043;"The ropes make noises, as we have decided to left the car behind and cross the bridge. We have shouldered our equipment. We make one step after another, looking only forward. The noises become louder. 'Maybe that was not the the best idea', I suggest. Henry doesn't give an answer. His hands are trembling. His hands staring to the ropes. 'The ropes! The ropes are ripping - go back, before the whole bridge collapses!"" But his warnings are to late. It seems, that we have overloaded the old bridge, tearing the ropes in pieces. Yelling and cryings later, clutching the salvaging ropes with both hands, we dangle above the abyss, seeing our equipment falling in the depth of Andean valleys. We are save, hanging at the clip, but lost our equipment. An idea comes to our mind: this bridge was an Incan trap. And without our provisions we are forced to give up.";;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201044;Lost in the mountains;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201044;Taking the vehicle wasn't the best thing we could do. Now, that we have been for days in the Andes, we realize that the steep and inhospitable mountains are not made for such a technology. There are no more streets we can take, and we are running out of fuel. Even our provisions are used up.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201045;Peruvian Sky;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201045;It was not easy to persuade Henry, but after hours of discussion he indulges. We take the 'Atalanta', an aircraft which the government provided us. After the take-off, Henry takes his diary, searching the bookmark in it. 'Manco Capac', he notes. 'The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ state is searching for his remains? I didn't know that there are such optimists in the government.' His voice has turned in a sarcastical mood. Henry searched the last five years for a sign of the legends associated with Manco Capac. Manco Capac, the last glorious King of the Incas. He fought the Spanish in a rebellion. He moved from Cusco to Vilcabamba and made the latter city his new capital. The last capital of the free Incan people. The discovery of Machu Picchu made many archaeologists believe, that there could be more historical sides nearby. 'You should fly lower', Henry proposed, ' we can't see anything.' 'But there is fog, and the mountains are clouded. It is too risky', I reply. But Henry is not convinced: 'And what happens, if we overlook something?';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201046;The crash;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201046;Wreckages lay lounge around. The smell of fire comes from the motor. The aeroplane is battered, pieces of metal gleam in the Andean sun. I can rescue my colleague out of the wreck. Henry is unconscious, but alive. My manouver was a bit too confident,I wasn't able to see the rough cliffs in the clouds. Our journey is over, as I decide to return to Cusco.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201047;A temple? A temple!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201047;We have won hight. The scenery becomes miniature. Henry, who was at first against this decision, suddenly seems interested. 'Did you see that?' 'What?' 'I bet I saw a temple! Look! There! I'm sure, on this plateau', he points with his finger on the window. A temple! Henry was right. It was buried by the mountains, but here in the sky, from above, it is clearly to see. 'We must land!', Henry becomes excited. 'Immediately!' I see the look in his face. He is a rational and cold mind, but when it comes to an archaeological discovery, Henry changes. It seems, that he can smell this type of things. But I can't share his opinion. The plateau is not the best field to land. It is not very large, and it would cost me a lot of courage to do this bold step.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201048;Temple lost out of sight;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201048;I searched for a better place to land, but when I found it, it was nearly impossible to find the place where the temple was. I made a second round to rediscover the Incan monument, but it was without success. Henry made his own expedition by foot, which resulted in failure. After weeks of useless search, we gave up hope to find the temple again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201049;The Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201049;I was able to land 'Atalanta', despite my concerns. The aeroplane landed softly on the plateau, and Henry jumped out of the machine when the airscrew were still moving. I follow him, looking up to the temple which is in a surprising good condition. Too untouched to be true. 'On my voyages in Peru, I never saw a Incan temple in such a good shape', Henry mentions. 'That is an extraordinary discovery. The archaeologists at home would be astonished.' I go forward, Henry waits instead, putting his hand on the stone. He observes the strange engravings. 'Any information?', I ask, but he denies. 'That seems to be a very strange place. I can't interpret this figures. It's a shame that the Incas have no writing or hieroglyphs as the Mayas do, so everything remains obscure.';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201050;Breakfast with Llamas;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201050;Manco Capac, eh? You two are searching for the remains of the famous last Incan ruler? Follow me!' A native offered his service. Now we travel through the Peruvian mountains, our equipment and ourself carried by llamas. Henry is convinced, that a voyage with this creature, which were domisticated to reach even the most inhospitable areas of the Andes, will be more useful than the new technologies. But when I turned to him, I saw his grim face. 'Henry, what is the matter?' 'I don't trust this man', Henry answers. 'It would be better if we buy the llamas and leave him instead. For me, he knows too much.';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201051;Weren't we here once before?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201051;Days and weeks go by. It took this long time after I realized, that Henry was right with his assumption. This llama leader wanted to trick us. Unfortunately, it was to late. When we wanted to confront him, he escaped with the llamas. It took us days before we were able to return to Cusco, exhausted and without equipment or success.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201052;Through the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201052;Without a leader, we are shift for ourself. The journey continues, but the problem of disorientation becomes obvious. Henry spent five years to examine Incan culture, chasing every evidence regarding the legendary capital of Manco Capac, Vilcabamba. But this area is unknown to him. Wandering through this inhabitated landscape drives us to despair. No ruins. No Incan remains. Nothing. Which direction should we take?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201053;Lost in the Andes;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201053;The blue heaven. The golden sun. Grey stones and mountains. Nothing has sense. We don't find the way to a promising archaeological place. We don't even find back home. The Andes are our grave, and maybe one day we will be found by other archaeologists, in thousands of years, making a good sample for an exhibition...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201054;The Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201054;The sunset brightens the sky in red colours, shining on stones. Stones of a building. On the top of a plateau, an old temple sits enthroned like an Incan god-king above the Andes. I tether the llamas, but Henry keeps going forward. 'On my voyages in Peru, I never saw a Incan temple in such a good shape', he mentions. 'That is an extraordinary discovery. The archaeologists at home would be astonished.' I go forward, Henry waits instead, putting his hand on the stone. He observes the strange engravings. 'Any information?', I ask, but he denies. 'That seems to be a very strange place. I can't interpret this figures. It's a shame that the Incas have no writing or hieroglyphs as the Mayas do, so everything remains obscure.';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201055;War interrupts expedition;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201055;The communication between our expedition in Peru and our archaeological society is interupted. Until the war goes on, our enemies will try to disturb every information exchange.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201056;Expedition in Peru responds again;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201056;Immedietly after the end of the war, the expedition in Peru has contacted us again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201037;Tutankhamun's Tomb discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201037;The discovery of this archaeological sensation is an international event. What should we do now, regarding the Great powers?;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201038;El Mirador discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201039;The Tower of Babel discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201058;The Temple of the Sun;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201058;We searched for hours, but we didn't find the entrance. A huge portal marks an area, which we identify as a possible gate, but it it is closed by a huge stone slab. Knots of alpaca hair is hanging above us, corded in strange knots. 'A quipu! At least something.' Henry seems facilitated. The Incas wrote their messages in a complicated systems of knots, why we call them also 'talking knots'. Henry is able to decipher it, but his look is confused. 'But... that can be true. The most quipus were conserved in the coast regions. In the mountains, nearly 90% are rotten.' 'Henry, please, continue the translation', I interrupt. 'We have later time for these investigations.' Henry grumbles, cathces a breath. Than he proceeds: 'Sacrifice the flesh of an animal/ the flesh of a tree/ the flesh of the sea/ and the flesh of the earth./ Finally, after five pounds of llama wool/ you will see Intis sun.';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201059;The Labyrinth;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201059;We gathered the asked goods. The are forced to give up our provisions, and I sacrifice my golden pocket watch, to fullfill the 'flesh of a god' part. Lastly, we lay the llama pelts, which we took with us - fearing the cold of the night in the Andes - to the other pieces of the sacrifice, in front of the slab. 'That is ridiculous', Henry delivers. 'What comes next? Will Inti step down from the sky and open the door?' 'Do you have a better idea?' 'Maybe not a better one, but at least not so dumb like this unscientific proposal!' I want to respond, but the sound of a shattering rock breaks in. The ground trembles, shakes, and rips. The food and the wool vanish in a dark hole, together with dust and gravel. After a moment of shoke, we decide to climb down. Henry takes his rope, and after a while, we abseil in the darkness. The spark of a torch later, we stare at corridors, stairs, different floors and bizarre constructions. I never saw such an amazing compilation of dizziyng architecture.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201060;Donwstairs;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201060;After a hard downfall, we realize, that we are cought in a pit. I grab the torch, fire is enlightning the environment again. 'Henry?' 'Yes?' 'Why is the ground moving?' Silence follows. I lower the torch - we are surrounded by snakes!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201061;Upstairs;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201061;We reach a higher level, following a passage through a tunnel. 'Something seemsâ€¦ similar', I notice. 'What?', Henry asks - following a strange sound, like a switch, which is now activated...;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201062;It's a Trap!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201062;AHHHHHH!' Our screams echoes in the labyrinth, followed by the sound of the gigantic stoneball behind us. At least, we are able to escape in a save corridor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201063;The corridor;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201063;Reconsidering our situation, taking the corridor was a bold step. Everything seems confusing, and when we go upstairs, it seems that we go downstairs. Each step could be a trap. And there are many different routes we can chose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201064;Lost in the Temple;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201064;Right. Left. Left. Right. Upstairs. Downstairs. Deadlock. Return. Right. Upstairs. Deadlock. Return. Return. Left. Right. Corridors, scales, floors - everywhere. I give up. We are completly lost in this strange place. There is no exit, no way out!;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201065;The Sanctuary;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201065;A wide hall. Symbols and scenes decorate the walls. It seems, that we have left the labyrinth. We look up, to the ceiling, higher than 20 feet. Snakes, made of stone, surround a portal on the other side. He sits on a bench, a plate on his thighs - the food on it, which we 'sacrified'. He is skinny and old. He notices us, but doesn't react. While he is eating, we come nearer. 'Im sure, that behind this portal, there is something very imporant', I say to Henry. 'Clearly. An old, skinny man is guarding it. Every important chambered is guarded ba an old, skinny, mysterious. Hell, he lacks only a long white beard and a crusader-sword!' Henry...', I try to . Henry can become very sarcastic in such situation. 'And he is eating our provision!' 'Please, please... don't be so loud, my ears', quits the old man his meal. 'If you calm down, I'm willing to answer your questions. This is the Temple of the Sun. A holy place. And I'm the guard of the heritage of our progenitors.';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201066;The Decision;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201066;It's the duty of my family to protect this place', he begins. 'Since generations, one man in one generation takes it on. The people from the near villages come to this sanctuary, bringing food and clothes, so I can concentrade on my service. But, times are changing. And I can't protect a culture which will die. The young people in the Andes are not interested in our past or our religion.' He stands up, nodding, than he looks to us. 'I know what you want. But do you really know what you want?' 'Oh that is such a clichÃ©. An old mysterious man is protecting an ancient place, all his life, and then, when - casually - two archaeologists come around, he spends time on philosphical phrases...' 'Henry!' 'It is true!', my colleague underlines. The old man grins. 'Anyway', he begins, 'what are you going to do?';;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTNAME201067;Temple of the Sun discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201067;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ has found the Temple of the sun, a magnificent testimony of Incan art, build under the rule of the last great Inca, Manco Capac II. Wonderful and precious artfeacts were found and brought to the National Museum.;;;;;;;;;;;;x;
EVTDESC201068;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ has found the Temple of the sun, a magnificent testimony of Incan art, build under the rule of the last great Inca, Manco Capac II.

EVTDESC201069;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ has found the Temple of the sun, a magnificent testimony of Incan art, build under the rule of the last great Inca, Manco Capac II.
