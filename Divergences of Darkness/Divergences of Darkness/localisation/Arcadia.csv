ARC12.D;Since the end of the colonial rule, Arcadia has been a place of constant rivalry and warfare. Immigrants hoping to flee from the war-torn Europe arrived here only to find more violence and bloodshed. But now it is possible that this era is over. Pan-Arcadianism, the idea of united Arcadia, idea that has been something only avid Romantics have dreamt of...maybe this dream of freedom and unity can actually see reality?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ARC13.D;With the discussion over a new capital of Arcadia being now taken to an official level, two actual options have arisen for the construction of Tripolis, symbolical soul of the young union. Cap Valois, on the Atlantic Coast with the advantage of strategic position, but deep in Septiman territory and Nye Nidaros, territory originally contested by all the three nations in the heart of the continent...but far from urban important centers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
ARC14.D;Representatives of Plantagenians, Septimans and Vinlanders have arrived to Nye Nidaros, a middle ground of all the three nations, eager to discuss the possibility of the union existing not only on paper.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x

ARC17.D;Sadly, the Congress collapsed into petty squabbles and one of the delegations eventually stormed off and the concept of Pan-Arcadianism can now only be enforced by raw power…;;;;;;;;;;;;;x
