EVTDESC4435;A family was caught attempting to sneak across the border today, the latest in a spate of such incidents.

EVTNAME4436;Immigration Quotas Questioned;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC4436;The plight of an immigrant family that has spent three years trying to get permission for relatives to join them in $COUNTRY$ has recently come to the attention of the government. The family meets all criteria for immigration except for one: the quotas have reached their limit, and officials have no recourse but to sometimes deny those who would otherwise be welcome. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ expatriates in other countries have held demonstrations against the policy, claiming it is based in racism and old-fashioned thinking. Conservatives say it is the only way to prevent immigrants from overrunning the system and causing chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC10140_NEW;Liberal causes have started to gain traction in $COUNTRY$. While no one knows for sure, rumor has it that the root cause of this sudden upswing in liberal propaganda efforts is the recent foundation of a secret society, forced into hiding due to the persecution of any legitimate opposition to the ruling party. Whether it be the Rosecrucians or the Illuminati, these society members will continue to act from the shadows until $COUNTRY$ allows free debate and opposition in its politics.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10150_NEW;The smog from the factories hangs low against the blood red of a charcoal sky. Far away in the depths of the city, in the deepest bowels of the industrial machine, the cries and shouts of a forming mob can be heard echoing against a backdrop of drainpipes and smokestacks. Infuriated over poor working conditions, clamoring for a return to a lost pastoral dream remembered, Luddites take to the streets in $COUNTRY$.;;Der kohlschwarze Qualm der Fabriken hängt tief gegen den blutroten Himmel. Tief im Herzen der Stadt, in den untersten Kellern der Industriemaschine, kann man die Schreie und Rufes des sich bildenden Mobs im Echo gegen den Hintergrund von Kühlröhren und Schornsteinen hören.

EVTDESC10160_NEW;Immorality is like water, flowing through every concievable crack in the dams of legal authority. Liberals in $COUNTRY$ have, on account of the ban on public meetings, begun holding banquets.

EVTDESC10200_NEW;Death to the $MONARCHTITLE$!', a hoarse voice cries. The streets in $PROVINCENAME$ have come alive. A local injustice, or the perception of one, have animated the unwashed masses into rebellion against our rule and threatens to spread to the rest of the state. The revolt is still small enough that its future course has not been set in stone, and leniency might avert it, but perhaps it is best to put our foot down firmly to set an example?;;Tod dem König!', schreit eine heisere Stimme. Die Straßen in $PROVINCENAME$ sind zum Leben erwacht. Eine lokale Ungerechtigkeit bzw. das, was manche dafür ansehen, hat eine Rebellion der ungewaschenen Horden gegen unsere Herrschaft entfacht.

EVTNAME10205;Fighting in the Streets;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10205;Tensions in one of our provinces reached a boiling point recently, with liberals and reactionaries battling in the streets. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police were quick to move in, but tempers remain high and already there are reports of fighting elsewhere in the state. Officials are calling for decisive action to put an end to the violence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC10215;Nationalists in $COUNTRY$, inspired by the wave of liberalism in a neighboring nation, have risen up.

EVTNAME10221;Chartist Rally in Kennington Common;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10221;A massive demonstration by the Chartists has taken place in Kennington Common, with liberals demanding that the People's Charter be implemented immediately-- giving equal votes to all men, rich or poor, as well as secret ballots and a fair distribution of constituencies. Many in the government are suggesting that such public gatherings should be made illegal, and that at best the British government should make empty promises to these rabble-rousers. Others fear that refusing their demands will lead to the monarchy being toppled by rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME10222;The French Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10222;Angry crowds have flooded the streets of Paris, shouting cries of 'Down with the King!' and 'Long live the Reform!'. They have erected barricades in the streets and fighting has broken out with the Parisian municipal guards. With the city having been completely closed off from outside help, these crowds have begun to march on the royal palace. Our king has had no choice but to abdicate and flee the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME10223;Louis-Napoleon's Coup d'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10223;Facing the prospect of losing the presidential election, the popular Louis-Napoleon has launched a coup d'etat and overthrown the French government. Loyal members of the army have locked down strategic locations in Paris, and the Assemblée Nationale has been dissolved, leaving Louis-Napoleon as the undisputed ruler of the country. He has been christened Napoléon III, regaining his uncle's throne as the Emperor of France.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME10224;Emperor Napoleon Deposed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME10225;Hungarian Revolution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10225;The Hungarian Diet has grown increasingly independent of Austrian rule in recent years. Field Marshall Count Franz Philipp von Lamberg was sent to Hungary to take personal control over their armies, but was attacked upon his arrival. In response, the Austrian government ordered the Hungarian Diet dissolved and the Ban of Croatia installed in Lamberg's place. The Hungarians have refused to obey, and thus we now face civil war to maintain the integrity of the empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME10227;The Hungarian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10227;Hungarian lands rightfully belong to us. With their new-found freedom, we are left with the decision whether we should pursue our claim to their lands or instead try to reconcile with the Hungarian government. If they remain hostile, after all, and we are unable to defeat them, they will become a very dangerous enemy on our border. Admitting their loss, however, might be a blow to our prestige we will never recover from.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME10228;Constitutional Reform;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC10228;With the entire nation ready to overthrow the monarchy, ministers have approached the King with advice on reforming the constitution before it's too late. The loss of Belgium has made a revision necessary already. Including provisions that permitted the direct election of the lower house as well as numerous freedoms the Dutch do not already enjoy might pacify the liberals.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME11100_NEW;The Unification of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11100_NEW;A rising tide of liberal nationalism within $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ has begun to spread, raising the idea of a $UNION_ADJ$ union with $COUNTRY$ at its head. A parliament of liberal revolutionaries has been convened, with representatives from throughout $UNION_ADJ$ lands, which has decreed the time is right for the nation to unite under one banner. The parliament has offered the crown of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ to us. We could accept the offer, but doing so would cause international alarm, and require us to compensate the revolutionaries politically.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME11104;Revolution in $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11104;A pro-$UNION_ADJ$ revolution has taken hold in $FROMCOUNTRY$. Its liberal leaders believe that $COUNTRY$ is the nation best-suited to unite all of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$, and thus have sworn to support us until the union is ready to occur.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC11108;The call has gone out for the Slavic nations of the Balkans to finally unite under a common banner, to resist the encroachment of the Austrians and Turks as well as other European powers. Yugoslavia, it is said, will be a power to rival even its most powerful neighbours. Whether this new nation would succeed in holding together a people divided by centuries of bitter warfare is best left for speculation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME11109;The Creation of Greater Finland;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11109;The call has gone out for the Ugric nations of Greater Finland to finally unite under a common banner, to resist the encroachment of the Russians as well as other European powers.

EVTNAME11110;A North German Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC11110;An open discussion amongst liberals in $COUNTRY$ has been occurring regarding the formation of a confederation of North German states. Conditions have never been right for it in the past, but many believe such a union is needed if the Germans are ever to have true security and take their place among the powers of the world. A $COUNTRY_ADJ$-led movement to create such a confederation might go over well with our neighbours, if we made the attempt to create it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC13040;Despite the obvious rightness of our country's trade policies, greater amounts of foreign goods could be useful, and elements within our administration have suggested setting up a limited trading post in one of our coastal cities, where foreign ships can moor and trade, without compromising the cultural integrity of $COUNTRYNAME$. It could be an economic boon to the area and the nation, but conservative voices warn that destructive foreign influences might further creep into our society.;;Trotz der offensichtlichen Richtigkeit unserer Isolationspolitik könnte eine gewisse Menge ausländischer Güter uns von Nutzen sein.

EVTDESC13050;A sweet, pungent stench hangs over the backstreets and alleys in one of our cities, emanating and spreading in every direction from an epicenter at the foreign trade station. The European traders have brought with them the habit of opium smoking, and our subjects have taken to it on a scale that threatens to become epidemic. It seems that, for every new ship that lands, more and more of our people get caught in the deadly and pacifying web of addiction. What should we do?;;Ein süßlich-stechender Gestank hängt über den Hintergassen und -gossen in $PROVINCENAME$ und verbreitet sich von einem Epizentrum an der ausländischen Handelsstation in alle Richtungen aus.

EVTDESC13160;Sailors winding up drunk in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ prisons aren't normally affairs of state, but this is an exception. A navyman from one of the Great Powers has been arrested by officials in one of our cities, after having murdered one of our subjects in what appears to have started as a bar fight. The diplomatic attaché insists that the sailor be handed over to the country in question, and tried according to their laws. This presents us with a conundrum. Granting this privilege once is tantamount to allowing extraterritoriality to all foreign subjects, but not doing so might very well cause international uproar. This issue merits careful consideration.;;Betrunkene Matrosen, die in $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Gefängnissen landen, sind üblicherweise keine Staatsaffären, aber dies ist eine Ausnahme. Ein Matrose aus einer der Großmächte wurde in $PROVINCENAME$ verhaftet, nachdem er einen unserer Untertanen im Verlauf einer Kneipenschlägerei umbrachte. Der diplomatische Attaché besteht darauf, dass der Matrose den Gerichten seines Heimatlandes ausgeliefert und dort nach ihren Gesetzen verurteilt wird. Dies bringt uns in eine Zwickmühle. Dieses Privileg ist ein wichtiger Teil der Extraterritorialität, die allen Ausländern zusteht, aber wenn wir es nicht tun, sehen wir einem internationalen Aufschrei entgegen.

EVTDESC13220;Several of the Great Powers have in the past few years sought to establish formalized and permanent embassies in $COUNTRYNAME$, but up until now we've turned down their proposals.

EVTDESC37720;The death of Leopoldo O'Donnell has eroded Queen Isabella's support, to the point where a movement to overthrow her has rapidly developed. A mutiny by naval officers in Cadiz has provided the spark for a widespread revolt against Isabella's rule. Her chief minister and generals have deserted her, and Isabella was forced to flee into exile. For the moment, Spain stands without a ruler, and the provisional government argues over what its next step should be. Some favor abandoning the monarchy altogether, but most feel a new king should be selected. Isabella's heir, Prince Alfonso, is thought by many to be too much under her influence.

EVTNAME37735;A Return to Bourbon Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37735;The Spanish Republic has been contentious since its inception. After a series of failed governments, many Spaniards have come to favor a return to the stability of Bourbon rule.

EVTDESC37744;The Christinos have been spreading their propaganda into neighboring $PROVINCENAME$, and reports have it that their lies are finding a ready audience among the locals. We can put a stop to their efforts, though not without being rather indiscriminate in our arrests and reprisals among $PROVINCENAME$'s poor. Still, radical measures may be called for in order to stop the Christinos from gaining headway here.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME37745;Moroccan Border Dispute;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC37745;A heated dispute has arisen between the Moroccans and our government over the boundaries of our holdings in Melilla. Some believe the Moroccans are attempting to gain sympathy from the French, but we have it on good authority that there will be no aid coming for them. Now may be the time for us to exert some of our authority over this African upstart.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME38505;Death of the Sultan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC38505;The death of Sa'id bin Sultan Al-Busaid has left him with two sons, each of which has claimed Oman as their own to rule. The result of this struggle has brought in foreign mediation, with the resulting decree that the nation will be split into two sultanates: one in Zanzibar and one in Muscat, each ruled by one of Al-Basaid's sons.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44122;WebsterAshburton Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44122;We have concluded a treaty with $FROMCOUNTRY$, resolving several long-standing border disputes between our nations. In particular, the treaty has clearly established the border between Maine and the British colony of New Brunswick.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44150;54-40 or Fight!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44150;As American and British settlers begin to move to the west coast of North America, there has been a growing dispute as to who owns the Oregon Country. The entire region west of the Rockies (called Columbia by the British) has been explored by both countries and there are legitimate claims on either side. The British claim all the way south to the 42nd Parallel and the Americans north to the 54th Parallel. It's clearly a tense situation, and the specter of war with the British looms as politicians in the current election campaign are banging the drums of Manifest Destiny in order to gain support.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44151;The Columbia District;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44151;As American and British settlers begin to move to the west coast of North America, there has been a growing dispute as to who owns the Columbia District. The entire region west of the Rockies (called the Oregon Country by the Americans) has been explored by both countries and there are legitimate claims on either side. The British claim all the way south to the 42nd Parallel and the Americans north to the 54th Parallel. The situation is tense, and made more so by jingoistic American politicians calling for sovereignty over the entire continent. Even so, the American government has sent a delegation seeking a compromise in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44152;The Oregon Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44152;The British have agreed to a compromise, splitting the Oregon Country between us at the 49th Parallel. Any British lands held by us will be turned over to them, and vice-versa. Though some Americans are upset, many others are breathing a sigh of relief.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44153;Oregon Negotiations Break Down;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44153;The talks with the British have broken down, primarily due to the continuing calls by war-mongering politicians. Neither of our options now is very pleasant: either we abandon our claims to Oregon no matter what some might think, or we press ahead with the claims and brace for eventual war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44154;American Claims in Columbia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44154;As American and British settlers begin to move to the west coast of North America, there has been a growing dispute as to who owns the Columbia District. The entire region west of the Rockies (called the Oregon Country by the Americans) has been explored by both countries and there are legitimate claims on either side. Recently the situation has been exacerbated by American politicians rattling their sabres over their idea of 'Manifest Destiny', and they have pressed their claim all the way north to the 54th Parallel. It will almost certainly mean war, and our only consideration should probably be whether we wish to pursue another costly war with the Americans in North America when our time could better be spent elsewhere.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44155;Oregon Country is Ours;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44155;The British have elected to withdraw from Oregon and have signed a treaty to hand any American land over to us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44303;Pacification of the Metis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44303;It has taken time to settle the grievances following the Riel Rebellion, but treaties with the various Metis groups throughout the North-West territories have managed to properly incorporate them into Canada.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44305;Rebellions of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44305;Perhaps inspired by the American Revolution, colonists in both the Lower Canada and Upper Canada colonies have risen up in rebellion. They are frustrated by the lack of political reform, as well as the entrenched power held by the reactionary elites of the 'Family Compact', and agitators are demanding responsible government if not outright independence. The colonial government has moved to arrest the perpetrators as traitors to the crown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44306;Lord Durham's Report;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44306;Lord Durham has returned from his mission to investigate the causes of the rebellion in Upper and Lower Canada with recommendations to the British crown-- namely that the two colonies be united under a single responsible government through an Act of Union. He fears that, if we do not, we may be facing further rebellion just as was faced in America. Indeed, it is entirely possible the Canadian radicals could attract support from the Americans if they are not appeased.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44310;The Charlottetown Conference;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44310;A gathering of governors from our Maritime colonies in North America has also been attended by governors from Canada. According to reports, they are attempting to organize a larger confederation of the colonies with an eye towards eventual self-government. We would like to see the North American colonies be more self-reliant, so it may be in our best interest to allow this union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44315;The Canadian Dominion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44315;The colonial government of Canada has officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance. This will see the colony better able to protect itself without military support, and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see renewed rebellion there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44316;The Dominion of Quebec;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44316;The colonial government of Quebec has officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance.

EVTNAME44317;The Maritime Dominion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44317;The colonial governments of the Maritimes have officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance. This will see the colonies better able to protect themselves without military support, and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see rebellion there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44318;The Dominion of British Columbia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44318;The colonial government of British Columbia has officially requested that the crown permit them self-governance. This will see the colony better able to protect itself without military support, and considering their united stance it's entirely possible that should we refuse we will see rebellion there.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44320;The Rupert's Land Act of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44320;A bill has been passing through the British Parliament which would see the entirety of Rupert's Land-- all North American colonial territory between British Columbia and Ontario-- being given offered to the Canadian dominion. Currently the land is administered by the Hudson's Bay Company, and thus the Canadian government would be required to purchase it. Should they choose to do so, it would strengthen our ally greatly and relieve our overextended colonial holdings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44321;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has passed an act which would see the Canadian government offered control over all of Rupert's Land-- essentially all $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ territory in North America east of British Columbia. We would need to purchase the land from the Hudson's Bay Company at no small expense, though it would be one of the largest land purchases in history.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44322;The Rupert's Land Act Fails!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44322;A British act which would have seen us offered the rights to purchase all of Rupert's Land from the Hudson's Bay Company has been defeated. Canadian dreams of uniting the continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific have been dashed in one fell swoop! Citizens in $CAPITAL$ are outraged at this betrayal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44325;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Asks To Join Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44325;Relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$ are friendly, and thus the dream of a larger Canadian confederation has resurfaced. Delegates from $FROMCOUNTRY$ have made the journey to $CAPITAL$ with the goal of negotiating terms of joining our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44339;The Northwest Territories;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44339;The land north of the 60th parallel is inhospitable to settlers, but there is a growing concern that should the Canadian government not move to fully claim the territory another power will do so. It will take considerable political capital to convince the other world powers of Canadian dominion in the north, but many feel we must make the effort... and considering there are reports of gold in the Yukon it might be wise to do so.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44351;The British Columbian Proposal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44351;Representatives from British Columbia have met with Canadian delegates in $CAPITAL$ to discuss terms of their joining confederation. The only thing that appears to interest them is the building of a national railway linking the Pacific and the Atlantic. Without it, they say, the nation is too divided and they are more connected with other regions along the Pacific coast.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44355;First Stage of the CNR;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44355;The first stage of the Canadian National Railway, linking Winnipeg to the Atlantic Coast, has been completed. Now work must begin on the second stage, which will be considerably more difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44356;Second Stage of the CNR;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44356;The second stage of the Canadian National Railway, linking Calgary to the Atlantic Coast, has been completed. Now work must begin on the last stage, which will be the longest and most difficult yet as it requires creating a pass through the Rocky Mountains themselves.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44357;The CNR Completed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44357;After a massive effort expended to create a pass through the Rocky Mountains, the Canadian National Railway has been completed! A single railway now links the Pacific coast to the Atlantic. Crowds have gathered in $CAPITAL$ to celebrate the first locomotive being sent to make the complete journey!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44805;Antonio López de Santa Anna;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44805;A general and war hero of Mexican independence, Santa Anna was elected President in 1833. After deposing his liberal vice-president, Santa Anna abrogated the 1826 Constitution and took control of the country as a conservative dictator with both church and military backing. Many Mexican states objected to this centralization of power, and with the rebellion of Tejas to the north the entire country seems to be in a state of chaos.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44810;Rebellion in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44810;Malcontents in $STATENAME$ have risen up in defiance of the government, demanding a return to democratic rule!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44815;Texas Recaptured!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44815;The rebel state of Tejas has been recaptured. A glorious victory for Mexico, and a blow against the malcontents who seek to spread dissension and discord!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44820;Republic of the Rio Grande;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44820;Inspired by the success of the Tejas rebellion, liberal malcontents in the provinces along the Rio Grande have risen up and declared their independence from Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44821;The Yucatan Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44821;Angered by the abrogation of the 1824 Constitution and the centralization of government power in Mexico City, liberals in the Yucatan have declared their independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44822;Join the United Provinces?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44822;Eventually, the Mexican government will come after our country and seek to re-incorporate it into the federation. If we are to survive, joining the United Provinces of Central America may be our only hope. Shall we make the request?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44825;The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44825;With our capital under American control, it seems we have little choice but to negotiate. The Americans have offered us a deal: the normalization of relations, the forgiveness of our debt and the payment of a great deal of money... all in exchange for a cession of all the northern territories currently claimed by their country. If we refuse, it may mean many years more of war for us until these Americans get what they want.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44826;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44826;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has signed the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, ceding all American-claimed territory to our control. For now, the relations between our two countries can return to normal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44827;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44827;Despite having them over the figurative barrel, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused to capitulate to our demands. So much the worse for them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44830;Execution of Emperor Maximilian;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44830;Emperor Maximilian has never enjoyed popular support in Mexico, and now that insurgents led by Benito Juárez have captured him it seems his reign has come to an end. Court-martialed and executed by a firing squad, the new republic was declared only days after his death. Benito Juárez has assumed the role of President of Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME44835;The Plan of Tuxtepec;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC44835;Porfirio Díaz, General of Mexico and considered a hero by some, has overthrown the democratic government of Mexico in a military coup. Planned in secret with several military officers and announced in Oaxaca, it has disavowed the presidency of Sebastián Lerdo de Tejada and installed Diaz as a military-backed dictator.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME45102;La Trinitaria;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC45102;Juan Pablo Duarte has founded a secret society called 'La Trinitaria', seeking complete independence of Santo Domingo from Haiti and other foreign powers. Many Caribenos are calling the man a visionary, and his ideas are gaining great popularity in eastern Hispaniola.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME46303;War of the Farrapos;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC46303;Porto Alegre is under Brazilian control once again. The gauchos, however, have promised to continue their rebellion against what they consider unfair rule from the throne. It may prove difficult in the coming years to keep the region calm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME46304;Solano's Ambition;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC46304;The dictator of Paraguay, Solano Lopez, has turned his eye towards Brazilian lands to the southeast. Direct access to the Atlantic Ocean would be of great benefit to the country, rather than relying on Uruguayan permission to use the river-- permission which might not always be forthcoming, thanks to Brazilian interference. Perhaps it is time to flex Paraguay's muscle and establish an empire of our own?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME46605;The Argentine Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC46605;Unrest is stirring against the Rosas dictatorship in Argentina, with liberals demanding a constitution and a trasition to democratic rule. Justo José de Urquiza, the governor of Entre Rios, has approached the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and asked us to support an uprising should Rosas refuse the liberal demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME46610;The Constitutional Demand;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC46610;General Justo José de Urquiza, the governor of Entre Rios, has turned against the Rosas government and demanded that it submit to liberal demands for a new constitution. There are hints that neighboring governments might support Urquiza, and that should he rise up in rebellion against us they will intervene on his behalf.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME46611;The Argentine Constitution of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC46611;With Rosas unable to defeat the Entre Rios rebellion, he has been forced to flee Argentina and General Urquiza has assumed temporary control of the government. Meeting with liberals in Santa Fe, they have drawn up a new constitution which has created an Argentine Republic. The Buenos Aires province is displeased and vows to resist,but the wind of change is clear.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME46612;General Urquiza Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC46612;The rebellion in Entre Rios has been put down, and both General Urquiza and his liberal supporters have been captured and executed. The Argentine states have submitted to the will of Buenos Aires.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME49501;Reforming the Kalmar Union;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49501;Members of the $FROMCOUNTRY$ government have approached us, suggesting that the Kalmar Union must be ressurrected. For the moment, this is simply an idea, a suggestion that the Scandinavian nations should work together towards an eventual union. If we disagree, it's possible that the idea dies here. If we don't, $FROMCOUNTRY$ might be mortally insulted. If Scandinavians are to take their rightful place in Europe, however, perhaps there is merit in their proposal.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA49501;A royal marriage cannot hurt, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB49501;We see little reason to join such a union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME49502;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49502;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has refused the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ proposal. It is now in our hands whether to let the Union die here and now, or force $FROMCOUNTRY$  to join us whether they like it or not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA49502;Oh well, I guess that's over then.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB49502;We'll see how they feel with an army in their capital...;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME49503;Form a Customs Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49503;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has proposed the next logical step in our mutual cooperation: a customs union between $COUNTRY$ and $FROMCOUNTRY$, indeed all of Scandinavia, which would remove the restrictions on trade between us.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA49503;A customs union cannot hurt, I suppose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB49503;This is going too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME49504;Form a Political Union?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has suggested a political union between their country and $COUNTRY$, arguing that this is the next logical step for Scandinavia's security.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA49504;It seems like a logical argument.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB49504;This is going too far.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME49505;Norway Asks For Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49505;Your Norwegian subjects seek to establish their own independent kingdom. The other European powers support their independence, and will be upset if we refuse.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME49506;Norway Demands Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49506;This time they are not asking nicely. Independence or war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC49508;Your Danish subjects wish to end our union.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME49509;The Leadership of Kalmar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC49509;As our power in Scandinavia wanes and $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence grows, so does the focus of the union move to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC60010;Concerned by the growing chaos in $COUNTRY$, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ leadership has stepped in to declare martial law and assume full control over the government. Civil freedoms have been curtailed, and already there is a growing certainty in the streets of $CAPITAL$ that this is the beginning of a military dictatorship. Will the new government be so quick to relinquish power once the current crisis has passed?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME60121;Joining the Greater Union;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC60121;Since the revolution, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has awaited a contender who could unite $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$. Now that such a nation has arisen, many feel it is time to surrender our personal sovereignty towards the $UNION_ADJ$ cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90016;Archduke Ferdinand Assassinated;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90016;One of the most prominent members of Austrian aristocracy has been murdered by a Serbian assassin, a member of a group of nationalists who seek to rejoin with the Serbian nation.

EVTNAME90017;The Hungarian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90017;With the recent unrest in Hungarian lands, the local Hungarian government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME90025;Tunisian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90025;It has become increasingly obvious that the Tunisian government operates independently from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. We cannot continue to control them directly, and must either take measures to assert our dominance or allow them to seek their own path.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90026;The Young Ottomans;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90026;A group of liberal intellectuals that were responsible for the reforms of the Kanûn-i Esâsî have begun stirring up resentment of the Ottoman autocracy. They demand to see the power of the throne reduced to that of a constitutional monarchy, though advisors note that giving into their demands will only anger reactionaries determined to see the Empire's traditions maintained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90027;Greece Demands Thessaly;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME90036;Freedom in the Balkans;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90036;The Ottomans continue their brutal oppression of Orthodox Christians in the Balkans. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has been receiving calls for assistance from dissidents within the Empire, and the feeling among our own Orthodox citizens is that we should take a stand to help our brothers of the faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90038;The Pact of Plombières;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90038;We have been approached by a Sardinian envoy, the Count of Cavour, who has made an interesting proposal: an alliance to make war against Austria, gaining Sardinia the Austrian-held provinces of Lombardy. In exchange, Sardinia would hand over Savoy and Nice to France. It is an interesting idea, and one that allows France to take a role that would not paint us as the aggressors. Shall we agree?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90040;The Sepoy Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90040;A mutiny by a group of sepoys in the service of the British East India company has ignited lingering resentment amongst our Indian subjects into open resistance against our rule.

EVTNAME90041;Galician Slaughter;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90041;Polish peasants in Austrian-held Galicia have risen up and slaughtered wealthy landowners, leading to calls by nobility within the Free City of Krakow for a larger uprising.

EVTDESC90050;The duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have long been united and considered indivisible under the Danish crown, but a question of royal claim to the duchies combined with the Holsteinian desire to join in the larger German Confederation to the south has led to considerable difficulty for King Frederick VII. The treatment of Danish people in Schleswig living under Holsteinian domination has led to a call for the duchy to be incorporated into $COUNTRY$ proper. This is unlikely to be looked on favorably by the conservative German aristocracy in Holstein.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90051;The Annexation of Schleswig;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90051;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ crown wishes to annex the Duchy of Schleswig, which has long been considered indivisible from the Duchy of Holstein. The German aristocracy is enraged by this move. They believe their future lies with the German Confederation to the south, but the Duke of Augustenberg has a stronger claim to Schleswig than the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ King. Schleswig-Holstein must forge its own path, even if it means war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90052;Schleswig-Holstein Under Our Control;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90052;Now that order has been restored to Schleswig-Holstein, international pressure is mounting to uphold treaties regarding the region. Failure to restore nominal independence to the duchies and keep them united will result in tensions between $COUNTRY$ and other European powers, and possibly war with the German Confederation to the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90053;The November Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90053;King Frederick VII has died and left no heir. According to the recently-drafted constitution, the crowns of both Denmark and Schleswig would pass to Duke Christian of Glücksburg. The crown of Holstein is more problematic, however. The House of Augustenburg claims the crowns of both Schleswig and Holstein and is calling on German support. If the new consitution is signed, Schleswig-Holstein will be officially divided. If it is not, the Danish people will almost certainly rise up against their new king.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90054;The Schleswig-Holstein Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90054;The arrogant German aristocrats in Holstein have declared they intend to pursue a future with the German Confederation to the south, and consider Schleswig an indivisible part of their territory. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ militants are angrily calling for the military to step in, though some fear this may lead to war with the Germans.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90055;The question of Schleswig-Holstein's place within the German Confederation has now finally been resolved-- in our favor. This will have larger repercussions, as the free German states will see that $COUNTRY$ is the true leader of the confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90056;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has brought Schleswig-Holstein under German control, finally resolving its status within the confederation. This puts it in a unique position to assume leadership of the German Confederation as well as dominance over the North German states. We will need to take swift and decisive action if $COUNTRY$ is to maintain its position of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90057;Look to $FROMCOUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90057;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has brought Schleswig-Holstein under German control, finally resolving its status within the confederation. It's possible that aligning ourselves with $FROMCOUNTRY$ is far more in our best interest, as well as more likely to create a united Germany under North German dominance. We should reconsider our current allegiances.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90060;The Eastern Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90060;The Ottoman Empire has been in slow decline for much of the last century, but never has this been more apparent than in recent years. The Empire's hold on the Balkans is weakening, and this threatens to upset the entire balance of power in Eastern Europe as Russia and other countries will inevitably be drawn into the conflict. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government feel that it falls on us to call the powers of Europe together and negotiate a settlement that will restore some semblance of stability to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90061;Planning for the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90061;Now that plans for the conference in $CAPITAL$ are underway, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ statesmen are busy trying to determine what our stance on the issue should be. Some feel we should favor keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East. This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90062;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90062;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of $COUNTRY$ to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel this is a veiled attempt to carve up our nation, and an insult, but regardless we cannot let the congress go on without our attendance. We shall see what manner of 'negotiation' $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90063;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90063;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel this is a veiled attempt to bolster the shaky Empire's hold over the Middle East and balk Russian 'aggression'. Either way, we cannot let the congress go on without our attendance. We shall see what manner of 'negotiation' $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90064;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90064;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel we should favor keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East. This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them. Still others feel we should not take part in this veiled attempt at dismembering a sovereign nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90065;The Congress of $CAPITAL$: Keep the Empire Strong;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90065;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that the Ottoman Empire needed to be kept strong, and any demands placed on it should not weaken its interests unduly. Few of the attendees were pleased, the Russians in particular, and even though the Congress favored the Ottomans it remains to be seen whether they will bow to European pressure and uphold the Congress's edict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90066;The Congress of $CAPITAL$: Stabilize the Balkans;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90066;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans, with delegates from the Ottoman Empire also in attendance. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that creating stability in the region was best even if it came at the expense of the Empire's power. The Russian delegates were pleased, but Ottoman delegates left in a rage. It remains to be seen whether they will bow before the Congress's demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90067;The Demands of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90067;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with mixed news: though the consensus reached was that $COUNTRY$ needed to be kept strong, they still placed numerous demands upon us that would see the political map of the Balkans rearranged. If we choose to defy the European edict, we could be facing wars from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90068;The Demands of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90068;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with disheartening news: despite considerable dissension among those attending, a consesus was reached that creating stability in the Balkans is more important that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests and sovereignty. The demands are humiliating, and will see us losing much of the Balkans if we agree. If we defy the Congress, however, we could be facing war from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90069;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees to the Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90069;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent word to the European powers that it will abide by the decrees of the Congress. This proves to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government they are serious about working with the rest of Europe to maintain stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90070;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees to the Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90070;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent word to the European powers that it will abide by the decrees of the Congress. This proves to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government they are serious about working with the rest of Europe to maintain stability, though it is clear they are angered by the results.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90071;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Defies the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90071;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has decreed that it will not abide by the demands of the Congress. The Treaty, they say, is so much worthless paper, and they refuse to give up any of their sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90075;The Fate of Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90075;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now it has become all too apparent, and a threat to the vision of the Ottoman Empire as master of the Orient... something which has been little more than an illusion, but which the Ottomans must either address or have it shattered forever. War will come, and Egypt will either be beaten back into place and made to heel at its master's side or seek its own destiny as a power in its own right. Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90076;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90076;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now that independence has become all too apparent, and Ottoman mastery over the Orient is threatened. Either we must take steps to rectify the situation, and assert our dominance once and for all, or admit to the world that our power is little more than an illusion. There are those who feel that a peaceful solution is possible, and that the Egyptians might better serve as powerful allies than as implacable enemies, but that would require us to surrender our claim to Egyptian lands as well as be an affront to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90077;Negotiations with the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90077;While we expected immediate Ottoman reprisal, it seems our former overlords are willing to negotiate. Their proposal is as follows: split the Levant between Egypt and the Ottoman Empire, allow Ottoman influence to remain and they will permit our independence. Of course, while this would retain an alliance with the Empire it seems like many to hardly be true independence at all. Still, it would avoid a great deal of bloodshed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90078;Egypt Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90078;Our negotiations have been successful: Egypt has agreed to partition the Levant, and we retain influence within their territory. While this spares us a great deal of bloodshed (and the possibility of an embarassing defeat), it does mean we have lost control over the Christian Holy Land in Palestine-- something that will not go over well with the powers of the world, and with Russia in particular.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90079;Egypt Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90079;Despite our willingness to negotiate, Egypt has refused to accept any Ottoman influence in their territory... and also refuses to give up control over any of the Levant. We have no choice but to take it from them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90080;The Egyptian Levant;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90080;The Turks have proven unable to retake the Levant from us, despite all the assistance they have received from the rest of Europe. Even those great powers must now admit that the Levant rightfully belongs to us, and that the 'Sick Man of Europe' has no claim over it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90085;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90085;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Should the Egyptians successfully challenge Ottoman rule, it could upset the entire balance of power in the region... something that many feel would threaten $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests. Still others believe that $COUNTRY$ must remain neutral, despite the cost to our relations with the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90086;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90086;We have received word through the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ embassy pledging their support for the Ottoman Empire in our conflict with the Egyptians. This is heartening news.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90087;The Fall of Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90087;Our forces are on the run. It seems the hated Ottomans and their allies have won the day, and we have little choice but to submit to their demands. We can try to hold out and turn the tide, but it is far more likely that Egypt will simply be carved up into pieces by the imperialists if we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90088;The Egyptian Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90088;The Egyptians have raised the white flag, offering to abide by the Convention of London and return both Crete and the majority of the Levant to our control. Our advisors say that wresting control of the entire country is almost impossible, and that we should take the offer while we can and let the Egyptians go.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90089;End of the Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90089;The Egyptians have surrendered to $FROMCOUNTRY$ and agreed to abide by the terms of the London Convention. Stability has been restored to the Orient... for now. All that remains is for us to decide whether to end hostilities with the Egyptians and return any $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ lands that we hold.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90090;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90090;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Egyptian diplomats have contacted ours through channels, and suggested that support in its war would be appreciated and rewarded. The Ottomans, they rightfully point out, are after all no friends of $COUNTRY$. Such an act could earn us the enmity of the Empire and its allies, however, and thus feel we must remain neutral in the conflict despite the possible benefit to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90091;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the Egyptians;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90091;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If something isn't done it could develop into an alliance between Egypt and $FROMCOUNTRY$ that could lead to their intervention in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90092;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the Egyptians;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90092;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If we do not object now, that support could lead to their intervention in the war. That objection, however, could also be seen as aggression on our part and harm our relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90093;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Withdrawal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90093;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have sent a demand through diplomatic channels that we back down from our support of the Egyptians. Doing so will harm the influence we have gained in Egypt, but if we do nothing we risk retaliation from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90110;The Manifesto de Montecristi;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90110;Jose Martí, a Cuban intellectual and radical who has spent a great deal of time organizing émigrés in the United States, has returned to the colony and declared the Manifesto de Monticristi, an exposition of the purposes and principles of the coming Cuban revolution. It seems the uprising has been in the planning for some time, and if the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government intends to remain in control of Cuba it could have a battle ahead of it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90115;The Maine Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90115;To hell with Spain! Remember the Maine!\n\nA riot by Cuban Spanish loyalists recently broke out in Havana, leading to the destruction of the printing presses of four local newspapers which criticized the Spanish Army. The battleship USS Maine was sent to Havana in response to fears expressed by the American consulate that Americans in Cuba might be endangered. Not long after arriving, the Maine was rocked by an explosion, killing 268 of the crew and sinking the ship in the harbour. American newspapers have leapt on the event, painting pictures of Spanish atrocities which have whipped up the public into a rage. People are calling for war against Spain and intervention in Cuba.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90120;The Propaganda Movement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90120;Three Filipino priests have been executed in the Manila, charged with subversion. While the executions are said to have been just, they are now considered martyrs by the Filipino people and have inspired the creation of a literary and organization known as 'the Propaganda Movement'. The organization consists of Filipino émigrés in Spain, primarily liberals and students, who are attempting to increase awareness of the needs of the Phillipines and foster better relations between Spain and its colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90125;The Katipunan;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90125;We have received reports from colonial officers in Manila regarding rumors of a secret organization called the 'Katipunan'. Formed by anti-$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Filipinos, they reportedly seek complete independence for the Phillipines. It's possible that limited home rule might mollify some of these revolutionaries, but nothing short of freedom will satisfy them for long. Tracking them down among sympathetic locals may prove difficult.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90130;With the recent unrest in Cuba, the prospect of the Spanish government possibly selling the island to the United States has arisen. Should we attempt to pursue negotiations?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90132;The Spanish Have Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90132;After some negotiation, conducted in secret, the Spanish have finally refused to sell Cuba. More than one member of the government has been angered by this, seeing the island as naturally falling into the American sphere of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90133;Cuba is Ours;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90133;With no small amount of fanfare, Spain has agreed to the sale of Cuba to the United States.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90135;The Grito de Lares;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90135;With conditions in our Puerto Rican colony so poor, the notion of independence has begun to spread among the local Caribenos. Reports from the colonial governor state a revolt has begun in the town of Lares, one that may be difficult to put down.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME90140;The Intentona de Yauco;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC90140;We have received reports of an independence movement having been formed in Puerto Rico, with an uprising having been organized in the town of Yauco. While the movement doesn't yet have a great deal of support among local conservatives, many of whom are hoping there is still a chance to achieve independence from $COUNTRY$ through peaceful means, it's possible that their efforts could spread if we don't put a stop to it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95026;Liberian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95026;The Liberian colony was founded as a homeland for freed American slaves by the American Colonization Society. Now that Liberia is considered a financial drain on its resources, the ACS is urging Liberia to proclaim idependence and find its own destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95076;The January Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95076;A spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Russian Army has quickly erupted into a widespread insurrection, supported by high-ranking Polish and Lithuanian officers and politicians. The eyes of all of Europe are upon us, and if we deal with the insurgents too harshly it may hurt our relations with European powers. If we do not, however, the uprising may spread even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95085;The Finnish Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95085;With the recent unrest in Finnish lands, the local Finland government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95095;Norwegian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95095;The Norwegian government has formally requested to be granted full independence from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95200;Turkmen Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95200;A wave of nascent nationalism has begun stirring among the Turkmen peoples under $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership. While the notion of a Turkmenian state is still a new concept, the possibility exists for it to spread and even lead to full rebellion in time. We must watch this carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME95250;The White Rajah;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95250;Brunei's control over the southern regions has only ever been nominal, and the region has been self-governed under the Sultan of Sarawak. During a recent crisis, an Englishman by the name of James Brooke provided the Sultan invaluable assistance in restoring order, and has been bestowed with the title of governor. This 'White Rajah' is now effectively the ruler, and is seeking alliance with Brunei. We must either recognize the independence of an area we only barely controlled, or seek to assert our authority and perhaps anger the English in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95251;The Dutch East Indies;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95251;The Dutch East India Company has been slowly spreading its influence within the East Indies, and is urging our government to establish protectorates over the remaining sultanates on the islands. Indeed, they have been stirring up trouble in the region. Many within our government feel that if the Netherlands is to remain a power to be reckoned with, it must expand its colonial holdings.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95255;Indonesian Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95255;The call has been sent out for the peoples of the East Indies to unify under a common banner, for protection against foreign imperialism and to usher in a new world power to make the Europeans tremble. The people are cheering in the streets of $CAPITAL$ at the welcome news. Will $COUNTRY$ do its part?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95260;The Disunited States;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95260;With the end of the democratic government of the United States, there is a growing feeling among many Americans that the principles upon which the country were founded no longer apply. Talk of secession is frequent, if quiet," and as unrest begins to grow it's become increasingly more possible that liberal-minded states will attempt to pull out of the Union. If they do, we must be ready.;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME95261;The Sons of Liberty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95261;A group calling themselves the Sons of Liberty has secretly formed in $PROVINCENAME$, advocating either the overthrow of the totalitarian American regime or the secession of $STATENAME$ from the Union.

EVTNAME95502;The Age of Colonialism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95502;Word has reached $COUNTRY$ of a great meeting of colonial powers in Europe, wherein it was decided that African nations would be divided up amongst them-- as if our people were little more than children's toys discarded and left waiting to be picked up. This has caused a great deal of concern among those of our people with the knowledge to understand what this means. For others it has brought little more than resentment, as well as vows to fight for our independence when the day comes.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Europeans believe we are not civilized, and the tone of our contact with them is slowly changing from friendly interest in trade to a strange paternalism coupled with cultural superiority.

EVTNAME95508;The Sale of Assab;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95508;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ shipping company has come into the ownership of the Red Sea port of Assab, sold to them by a local Afar sultan. The port would make for an excellent coaling station, and perhaps even provide a base for $COUNTRY$ to expand our influence in the area. Pushing for more direct control, however, could cause tensions with Assab's owner-- who might feel they have greater right to the port than the sultan.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95509;The Red Sea port of Assab has been sold to $FROMCOUNTRY$ by the local Afar sultan.

EVTNAME95510;Rebellion in Eritrea;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC95510;With the Sudan in chaos, the Ethiopians have taken advantage of the situation to regain control over the Eritrean coastlands. Though we may yet regain control over the Sudan, we should consider whether the Eritreans must be punished for this trespass.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME96100;The Arab Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96100;A wave of nationalism has begun to spread among the Mashriqi, fueled by their resentment over $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule.

EVTNAME96106;Arab Uprising in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96106;We have received word of an uprising that has occurred in $PROVINCENAME$. A group of Mashriqi tribesman attacked the local $COUNTRY_ADJ$ garrison, and were quickly put down.

EVTDESC96110;Abdul-Aziz, scion of the House of Saud, has returned from exile in Kuwait. Not only that, the man has managed to forge an alliance with the southern Bedouin tribes and retaken Riyadh.

EVTNAME96165;Italian Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC96165;The Italians have managed to unify at long last, threatening $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the region. We will have to decide whether it is in our best interests to object or to make friends with the new rulers. What has been done cannot now be undone, after all, and a united Italy could be a formidable enemy or a powerful $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC96170;$COUNTRY$ has become the center of Italian nationalism, its people calling out for unification.

EVTNAME97000;The Revolution of Maria de Fonte;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97000;A growing dissatisfaction with the ruling government among Portugal's poor has grown into rebellion, spurred on by popular discontent with the prohibition against burials inside churches. The instigator of the initial riots is a woman by the name of Maria, and her nickname has come to be used to represent the rebellion-- which has a large contingent of peasant women among its supporters -- and which has been co-opted by revolutionaries in emulation of the rebellions elsewhere in Europe.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97001;Peasant Revolt in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97001;The Maria de Fonte rebellion has spread to $PROVINCENAME$, with the lower classes rising up in opposition to the ruling government.

EVTNAME97002;End of the Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97002;Portuguese forces have managed to restore order in the countryside, and the peasantry have been brought back under control. The danger of a royal coup has ended.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97003;The Emboscada;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97003;Spurred on by the spreading revolts in Portugal, Queen Maria II has suspended the constitution and installed a reactionary government presided over by João Francisco de Saldanha Oliveira e Daun, 1st Duke of Saldanha. This has served to spur on the country's liberals to outrage, and begun talk of civil war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97006;The Occupation of Angola;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97010;We have received an ultimatum from $FROMCOUNTRY$: surrender our colonies between Angola and Mozambique or suffer the consequences. The Portuguese people feel this is an incredible betrayal by the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$. They have traditionally been our ally, and now they are trying to bully our rightful colonial holdings out of us? It cannot be borne!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97015;Regicide of King Carlos I;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97015;Upon returning to Lisbon from a brief trip abroad, King Carlos I and the royal family had their carriage fired upon by republican activists as they passed through the Terreiro do Paço. Three of the bullets struck and killed the King, while another fatally wounded the heir to the throne, Luis Filipe. During the turmoil, the police killed the assassins... but the King and the royal heir were not saved and were pronounced dead at the Naval Arsenal soon afterwards. Manuel, the king's youngest son, has been quickly acclaimed as the new King of Portugal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97020;The Republican Coup D'Etat;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97020;With the monarchy already weakened by the death of King Carlos, republican opponents have been able to gather considerable support in the capital. Members of the Carbonária, republican youth, and elements of the army have instigated a coup d'état in the palace. The young King Manuel and his family have reportedly escaped for exile to England, and only days later a new Portuguese Republic has been declared in Lisbon.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97050;The Peru-Bolivian Confederation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97050;The confederation of Peru, South Peru and Bolivia represents a threat to our interests. If the confederation is given time to solidify, they could easily become a new powerhouse in South America-- and one that is no friend to $COUNTRY$. Thankfully there are signs that the confederation is unstable: the Peruvians chafe at the Bolivian leadership, and given enough incentive they might withdraw. If we act now, we might be able to stir our people against them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97055;End of the Confederation?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97055;With the recent losses suffered by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ forces, confidence in the confederation has eroded. If we attempt to keep it together, we must do so by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97060;The Uruguayan Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97060;Brazil has traditionally held the right to intervene in Uruguayan internal affairs as it sees fit, but in recent months the conservative Blanco government has proven to be increasingly intransigent. The rebel leader of the liberal Colorados, Venancio Flores, has approached us with the offer of an alliance: place him in power and Brazil has a firm ally in Uruguay once again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97061;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97061;After several recent political conflicts with Brazil, they have sent an ultimatum: place the rebel leader of the Colorados in charge of the government or there will be war. There are many in the government who feel that Brazil cannot be serious. Uruguay is no threat, and they would risk angering the Platine nations with an invasion? This insulting ultimatum should be refused, according to them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97062;Uruguay Rejects the Ultimatum;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97062;The Uruguayan government has rejected our demands. Perhaps they underestimate our willingness to see this matter to a swift end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97070;La Carta de la Esclavitud;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97070;General Juan José Flores, the president of the republic and considered by many to be its founder, has responded to his falling popularity by engaging in voting irregularities and seeking to annul the 1835 constitution in order to remain in power. This new constitution, nicknamed the 'Carta de la Esclavitud' (or the 'letter of slavery') would anger a great number of the country's liberal populace.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97075;The Era of Conservatism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97075;Gabriel García Moreno, called the father of Ecuadorian conservatism, has risen to power during a time of crisis. To some, he is exactly what the country needs to see it through these troubled times. To others he is a tyrant. In either case, Moreno now rules Ecuador with an iron fist.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97076;Settling Tarauaca;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97076;The jungles of Tarauaca lie in the heart of the Amazon, and rightfully belong to $COUNTRY$. Currently there are $COUNTRY_ADJ$ settlers eager for the opportunity to settle the region and have asked for the funds to assist them, though advisors say this may cause problems with neighboring states who also claim the territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97086;Through the judicious use of force, confiscation of native lands and the introduction of roads and other vestiges of civilization, conditions in $PROVINCENAME$ have greatly improved. The native patagonians are proving to be contentious, but their numbers are far too few for us to worry about.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97090;The Argentina-Chile Border Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97090;Now that the lands of Araucania and Patagonia are fully settled, the Argentinians have approached us to work out a border treaty.

EVTDESC97100;A dispute between local $PROVINCECULTURE$ leaders and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ officials in $PROVINCENAME$ has exploded into a riot, and the violence quickly spread throughout $STATENAME$.

EVTNAME97105;Rebellion Agaist Foreign Rule;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97105;A dispute between $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocrats and a foreign governor has exploded into a riots in $CAPITAL$. Many $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens wish to see $COUNTRY$ freed from the yoke of its oppressor, and are ready to rise up and fight against the foreign armies that are sure to come. The idea that $COUNTRY$ may become a battleground pleases few, however.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97106;Control of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ India;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97106;One of the Indian Princely States has declared itself free of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. As Queen Victoria is the Empress of India, it seems only fitting that $COUNTRY$ control the entire sub-continent. Letting one of the Princely States go, after all, will only encourage the others to do the same... and hurts our international prestige at the same time.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97107;Submission to the British;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97107;The British have demanded we once again submit to their rule as a Princely State. It seems we have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97110;The Stirrings of Indian Nationalism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97110;The people of India are diverse, consisting of numerous cultures and languages throughout the sub-continent. Seldom has there been any serious credence given to the idea of a single union crossing all cultural boundaries, save by force of arms. This has recently changed, with Indian nationalists in $COUNTRY$ calling for a true union-- one powerful enough to resist all imperialist efforts to conquer it. Surprisingly, their calls have received a great deal of attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME97115;Death of the Maharajah;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97115;With the death of Ranjit Singh, a vacany has been left in the leadership of the Sikh Empire which will not be easily filled. The Maharajah's heir died suspiciously within months, as did the heir to follow, all due to infighting among the princes and the Panjabi nobility struggling to maintain power. Many fear this weakness will surely bring the British down upon the nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Maharajah's heir died suspiciously within months, as did the heir to follow, all due to infighting among the princes and the Panjabi nobility struggling to maintain power. As Sikhs pour into the British frontier, it seems we are inevitably drawn into the conflict-- and there are some who believe that now might be the perfect time to strike.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97150;The Talambó Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97150;An alarming incident has occurred at the Talambó hacienda in Ica. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who has subsequently demanded the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. Considering it was not long ago that $COUNTRY$ fought for its independence from Spain, submitting to such an indignity would go over less than well with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97151;News has arrived in $CAPITAL$ regarding an incident in $FROMCOUNTRY$. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who subsequently demanded the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. They have done so, but some advisors bring up a possibility: if $FROMCOUNTRY$ is this fearful of Spanish power, perhaps now is the time to reassert our authority over our lost Spanish colonies? Cutting $FROMCOUNTRY$ down to size may force them to submit to our rule as a vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97152;News has arrived in $CAPITAL$ regarding an incident in $FROMCOUNTRY$. According to reports, a fight broke out between two Spanish nationals and a much larger group of locals. One of the Spaniards was killed. This would be nothing more than a local matter had the event not come to the attention of a Spanish admiral... who subsequently demanded the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government issue a full apology to Spain. Predictably, they have refused. This is a direct challenge to Spanish authority from a former colony. If we do not react in kind, we will lose a great deal of credibility. Perhaps now is the time to reassert our authority over $FROMCOUNTRY$? Cutting them down to size may force them to submit to our rule as a vassal.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97153;The Spanish Royal Commissary;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97153;A Spanish deputy by the name of Eusebio de Salazar y Mazaredo has arrived to negotiate with the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government regarding the Talambó incident. The problem, however, is that he carries with him the title of Royal Commissary. This is a title reserved for officials dealing with Spanish colonies, not ambassadors to sovereign nations. This is a deliberate insult to $COUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97155;Submitting to Spain;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97155;We have been overrun by Spain, and now have no choice but to surrender our sovereignty to our former colonial overlords. It is a bitter day.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97156;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Submits;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97156;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has arrived with the expected news: they have agreed to submit themselves to Spanish rule once again, if we so choose. Some might wonder if it's worthwhile for Spain to involve itself in South American affairs, particularly since they will ultimately try to rebel out from under us. Perhaps we have proven our point?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97160;The Return of the Imperialists;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97160;Spanish imperialism has raised its head once again, with the Spanish throne having gone to war with a neighbour in an effort to restore their lost influence. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are rightfully worried at what this means, and there are calls for us to take a stand.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97161;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Protests;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97161;An envoy from $FROMCOUNTRY$ has issued a protest to our involvement in South America, telling us in no uncertain terms that we are not welcome.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97165;Appeal to America?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97165;The United States claims it intends to protect the New World from encroachment from imperial powers in Europe. Now that Spain has made its imperialist intentions evident, perhaps it is time we put the so-called Monroe Doctrine to the test?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97166;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Requests Aid;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97166;The Monroe Doctrine dictates that the United States is responsible for protecting the western hemisphere from encroachment from imperialists in Europe -- such as what Spain is doing right now in South America. $FROMCOUNTRY$ has put the Monroe Doctrine to the test and appealed to us for aid, asking for an alliance in case Spain should decide to expand its influence even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97170;The Mahdist Uprising;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97170;A Sudanese religious leader by the name of Muhammad Ahmad has proclaimed himself the Mahdi (or 'guided one') and begun a war to unify the tribes in western and central Sudan. While the local government in Khartoum initially dismissed this man, further reports indicate the Mahdi possesses a great deal of magnetism-- and his rallying call of driving all foreign presence out of the Sudan has gained him a large following. These Mahdists may prove to be a serious threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97171;Mahdists in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97171;Followers of the Mahdi have struck again, this time in the province of $PROVINCENAME$. The religious leader's jihad against foreigners has sparked a local rebellion, one that the authorities have had a difficult time putting down.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97175;Chaos in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97175;The rebellion in $STATENAME$ has been going on for far too long, and we are in danger of losing control of the colony entirely. Local militants in $PROVINCENAME$ have gone so far as to declare their nation's independence... and while that isn't yet true, as $STATENAME$'s state of chaos is still far too widespread, it's an embarassment to $COUNTRY$ and,  given enough time, the militants might gain enough control to earn the colony's independence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97180;Return of Our Lands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97180;Rebels in a neighboring colony have destabilized it enough that the people there are calling out for $COUNTRY$ to restore order. This is our land, and it seems that the western powers have all but abandoned it to chaos. So why shouldn't we intervene? Still, there are some who say this will only damage our relationship with a power... one we cannot afford to anger.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97181;Colonial Uprising in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97181;We have lost control of the situation in $STATENAME$. The rebels have gained sufficient control that they have ejected the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governors and declared their independence... for now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97500;Sovereign Authority in the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97500;The French ambassador has arrived with the following demand: they wish the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to recognize them as the sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine, turning control over all Christian sites to the French. The Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca signed with Russia in 1774 states that they are the sole protector of Eastern Christians, and should we agree to the French demands it will almost surely lead to conflict with the Russians.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97501;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses Our Claim;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97501;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has refused our demand, stating that the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca grants Russia authority over Eastern Christians and not France. More than likely they simply fear what the Russians will do. A show of force combined with the enticement of a protective alliance might compel them, though that will certainly cause friction with the Russians and there are some who say we should discontinue this venture now while we still have the chance.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97502;French Escalation;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97502;The French are not willing to abandon their claims to the Holy Land. There have been several demonstrations of naval force along our coast, and these have been combined with offers of protection against Russian retaliation. If we agree, we have a friend in France but almost certainly war with the Russians. If we refuse, very likely we will have a war with France on our hands. Which would we prefer?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97503;The French have successfully pressured $FROMCOUNTRY$ into accepting their claim of authority over Christian holy sites in Palestine, authority which has traditionally belonged to us ever since the 1774 Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. This is a breach of the treaty and a threat to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97504;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has agreed that the French and the Roman Catholic Church should be the supreme Christian authority in the Holy Land, and have turned over control of Christian holy places-- including the keys to the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. This is in contravention to the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ treaty with Russia, and will no doubt lead to conflict, but is at the same time a boon to our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97505;French Authority in the Holy Land;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97505;Through a combination of military and political pressure, we now have no choice but to accept French claims in the Holy Land.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97506;In what is perhaps a foolish move, the French have pressure the Turks into accepting their sovereign authority over the Holy Land in Palestine... authority which has traditionally rested with the Russians since the Treaty of Küçük Kaynarca. The question simply remains whether we should interfere. While holy sites are not our concern, trade routes through the Levant lead to India... and a Russian war with the Turks could directly threaten our interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97507;The War is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97507;Russia has control over $CAPITAL$, and much of our nation is either overrun or in complete chaos. We cannot continue. Our only option may be to surrender to the Russians and negotiate a treaty, in which we will doubtless be forced to hand over many concessions. Failure to do so, or should the Russians refuse our offer, could mean the war continuing for a very long time yet-- and $COUNTRY$'s utter ruin.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Surrender;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97508;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has approached us, begging for terms of surrender. It will mean relinquishing our current wargoals and sitting down with them to work out the terms of a treaty once the war is done, but we are confident they will be to $COUNTRY$'s benefit. No doubt the other powers of Europe will be far less pleased, but that is not our concern. Such a treaty will prevent this war from continuing on interminably.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97512;As we suspected, the terms of Russia's treaty are punishing indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97510;The Treaty of Paris;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97510;The powers of Europe have met in Paris to settle the recent matter of the Crimean War. One of the provisions set out is that the newly-united Romanians would receive the Budjak in southern Bessarabia (also known as Izmail). Refusing would put us at odds with the rest of Europe and perhaps lead to further war. Accepting might repair some of our relations with Romania, but would definitely be a blow to our prestige and our interests in the region.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97515;Romanian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97515;To this day we remain a subject of the Turks. A growing movement has demanded our indpendence, and there are those who believe an offer of alliance with the Russians along with a guarantee of returning their lands in southern Bessarabia might entice them to support our efforts. Still others fear what a war of independence with the Turks will do to our nation. Is it worth it?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97516;The Romanians have approached us with a deal: in exchange for our assistance in their war of independence against the Turks, they will return our lands in southern Bessarabia. It is a way to regain our influence in the region, though it does come with a steep price.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97517;The Russians Have Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97517;We have received word from the Russian government: they have agreed to support our claim of independence in exchange for Izmail.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97518;The Russians Have Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97518;We have received word from the Russian government: they have refused to support our claim of independence in exchange for Izmail. We are on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97525;The cursed Romanians have coaxed the Russians into declaring war on us in support of their independence. We cannot let this stand!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97526;The Romanians have foolishly declared them independence. We must take action at once!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97550;The Federal Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97550;The Federal Republic of Central America has been chaotic since its inception. Liberals who had high hopes for the union are in constant battle with conservatives, in particular the clergy and wealthy landowners, and there is a general fear of domination by Guatemala. At this point, the struggle to maintain the union seems like an almost impossible one.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97551;Costa Rica Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97551;With rebels in Nicaragua having already declared its independence from the Federal Republic, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in southern Costa Rica. Government authorities have withdrawn as locals have overtaken the capital in San Jose.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97552;Nicaragua Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97552;With rebels in Honduras having already declared its independence from the Federal Republic, it has become next to impossible for the government to maintain order in Nicaragua. Government authorities have withdrawn as locals have overtaken the capital in Managua.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97553;Order Restored in El Salvador;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97553;The government has managed to restore order in the El Salvador region. Officials in San Salvador have re-dedicated themselves to the future of the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97554;Order Restored in Honduras;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97554;The government has managed to restore order in the Honduras region. Officials in Comayagua have re-dedicated themselves to the future of the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC97556;The government has managed to restore order in the Costa Rica region. Officials in San Jose have re-dedicated themselves to the future of the union.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97560;End of the Republic?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97560;The Federal Republic of Central America is rapidly disintegrating. Members of the government have met in $CAPITAL$ to discuss whether the union should be officially dissolved and the state of Guatemala declared, or whether we should fight to preserve what we have. Some consider that to be an impossible task, though liberals argue that we should not allow conservatives doom the region to a future of division and internal squabbling.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97561;Rebels in $CAPITAL$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97561;With our forces off valiantly facing the enemy, rebels have taken advantage of the situation and stormed $CAPITAL$. They have taken over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government and already done a great deal of damage in order to drive out foreign influence in $COUNTRY$. Without the forces to oppose them, there is little we can do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97562;$CAPITAL$ Burns;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97562;$CAPITAL$ has been taken by the enemy, and a great deal of $COUNTRY$ is lost to our control. Many are saying that we only continue the war because our foreign masters insist that we do so, and that the time has come for us to let go of these ties-- no matter the consequences. Perhaps they are right, though it seems the situation is dire for $COUNTRY$'s future no matter what we do.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97600;Sakoku;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97600;Meaning 'locked country', Sakoku was the foreign relations policy of Japan instituted by the Tokugawa shogunate in the 17th century, with no foreigner allowed to enter the country on pain of death. While some contact with westerners was permitted in the south, at the Dejima trade enclave in particular, such contact was strictly regulated and kept Japan in a state of isolation from the rest of the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97601;Rangaku;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97601;Meaning 'Western Learning', Rangaku referred to the body of knowledge developed by Japan through its contacts with the Dutch enclave at Dejima. Despite the enforced isolation of the nation, this policy of learning allowed western influences to spread-- particularly in the southern domains of Satsuma and Choshu.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97605;Kurofune;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97606;Commodore Perry Successful;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97606;Commodore Perry has returned from his mission to Japan with a treaty in hand: we have gained numerous trade concessions, but more importantly we have cracked open the shield that is Japan's policy of isolation. This is a great coup for American diplomacy and influence in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97607;The Japanese Are Defiant!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97607;Commodore Perry has returned from his mission to Japan with unfortunate news: they have chosen to defy his ultimatum and thumb their collective noses at our government. Should we back down now, it will be a great blow to our prestige and our influence in the Far East.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97608;Japanese Surrender?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97608;We are being overwhelmed by the superior might of western armaments. Despite the loss of face, we must consider offering the hated foreigners terms of our surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97609;The Japanese Have Surrendered;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97609;We have formally concluded a treaty with the Japanese which will see our influence restored, and our demands for their ports to be opened to our ships to be met. Additionally, an indemnity will be placed upon their government to make up for the expense of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ war effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97610;The Japanese Have Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97610;Despite the overwhelming odds against them, the Japanese have refused our generous offer of surrender.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97615;Sonno Joi;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97615;'Revere the emperor and expel the barbarians!'\n\nThis is the slogan chanted by neo-confucian activists, reacting to the Tokugawa shogunate's opening of Japan to foreigners. There have been growing reports of violence all over the country, primarily against foreign visitors and statesmen but also against the shogunate itself. Each incident chips away at Tokugawa control over the daimyo and erodes relations with the western powers.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97616;$PROVINCENAME$ Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97616;There has been an incident in $PROVINCENAME$ where samurai, acting under the political slogan of 'Sonno Joi', have committed violence against foreigners conducting business in $STATENAME$. The incident has affected the Tokugawa shogunate's relations with foreign powers, as well as incited locals into riot.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97617;Order to Expel the Barbarians;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97617;In an unprecedented move, the Imperial Court has issued an edict to expel the foreign barbarians present in Japan. This runs in contravention to the traditional role of the Emperor as a figurehead, is a challenge to the shogunate's power, and may serve to further incite rebellion.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97618;In an unprecedented move, the Imperial Court has issued an edict to expel the foreign barbarians present in Japan. This runs in contravention to the traditional role of the Emperor as a figurehead, and is a challenge to the shogunate's power. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ clan must decide whether it supports the Emperor's edict or quietly opposes it.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97620;The Death of Iesada;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97620;Tokugawa Iesada, the 13th shogun of Japan, has died childless. This has begun a struggle within the bakufu to select a replacement. The southern tozama daimyo wish to see Tokugawa Yoshinobu become shogun, while the fudai daimyo and shogunate officials are more in favor of Tokugawa Iemochi-- even though he is still but a child. It seems certain that, no matter which candidate is victorious, the disaffected daimyo will see this as a loss of power and make trouble.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97621;Tokugawa Yoshinobu is Shogun;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97621;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Yoshinobu as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the tozama daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the tozama will be permitted more influence within the shogunate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97622;Even though the fudai daimyo, the relatives and close allies of the Tokugawa clan, supported the appointment of young Iemochi as the new shogun following Iesada's death, instead the leader of the bakufu will be Yoshinobu... a candidate favored by the outsider tozama daimyo. The fudai are growing increasingly alarmed at the insidious influence of the tozama, and there is a stirring sentiment that perhaps the time has come for a grander change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97623;Tokugawa Iemochi is Shogun;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97623;Pandering once again to the fudai daimyo, all relatives and close allies within the bakufu, the child Iemochi has been appointed shogun-- instead of the more sensible candidate chosen by the tozama. It is becoming increasingly clear that a larger change is necessary. Perhaps the time has come for the Emperor to rule Japan, a single leader to bring the nation into this new era?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97624;The shogunate has taken a step in the right direction and appointed Tokugawa Iemochi as the new leader of the bakufu following the death of Iesada. This was always the preferred choice of the fudai daimyo, and perhaps it is a sign that the bakufu is not only willing to do what it must to keep Japan strong but also a sign that the outsider tozama will have their influence in the bakufu kept to a minimum.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97625;Sakuradamon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97625;The shogun's Chief Minister has been assassinated by ronin samurai outside the very gates of Edo castle! Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point. Many are urging that a policy of Kobu Gattai-- a union of the bakufu and the imperial court-- may be required.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97626;The shogun's Chief Minister has been assassinated by ronin samurai outside the very gates of Edo castle! Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point, and thus the bakufu has begun a compromise policy of Kobu Gattai-- a union of the bakufu and the imperial court. Some are seeing this as a sign of further weakness.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Though the ronin were either cut down or committed seppuku, a manifesto found on their bodies makes it clear their act was a reaction to the recent purge instigated by the Chief Minister against agitators within the shogunate. This is a clear sign that upheaval against the bakufu has reached an unacceptable point, yet the shogunate refuses to compromise with the imperial court. Many are certain this will only speed up the coming conflict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97630;The Death of Emperor Komei;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97630;There are some who believe that Emperor Komei was assassinated-- delivered a handkerchief laced with smallpox, perhaps by radicals who fear the possibility of compromise between the bakufu and the imperial court. No matter the truth, the death of the Emperor has placed the young Emperor Meiji upon the imperial throne and eliminated any chance of compromise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97635;Opposition to the Bakufu;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97635;There is a growing restlessness among the daimyo, with some whispering that the Tokugawa shogunate has grown weak and is unable to deal with the encroachment of foreign powers. Officials within the bakufu are urging that we seek allies among either the outsider tozama or the traditional fudai, to strengthen the shogunate's position. Approaching one means angering the other, of course, but it appears we have little choice.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97636;There is a growing restlessness among the daimyo, with some whispering that the Tokugawa shogunate has grown weak and is unable to deal with the encroachment of foreign powers. We have received word that the shogunate has consulted with the outsider tozama, perhaps seeking new allies. If so, this compounds injury with insult.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97637;There is a growing restlessness among the daimyo, with some whispering that the Tokugawa shogunate has grown weak and is unable to deal with the encroachment of foreign powers. We have received word that the shogunate has consulted with the fudai daimyo, perhaps seeking new allies. This is hardly unexpected, though the tozama agree this makes it clear that the shogunate is not the future of Japan.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97640;The Meiji Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97640;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ clan has made a bold move: they have seized control of the palace at Kyoto and declared they intend to see the emperor restored to rule over Japan. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ must make a decision: do we throw in our support with the imperial court, or do we uphold our duty and support the shogun?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97641;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ clan has made a bold move: they have seized control of the palace at Kyoto and declared they intend to see the emperor restored to rule over Japan.

EVTNAME97645;We Are Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97645;The Edo palace has been occupied, and our loyal daimyo are on the retreat. Our advisors tell us that our only option is to lay down our arms and allow the Emperor his victory. There is a place for the Tokugawa within the new order.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97646;The Meiji Restoration;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97646;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ clan forces have marched triumphantly into Edo, and the Tokugawa shogunate has agreed to a permanent peace. For the first time since before the Sengoku, the Imperial Court now rules Japan once again. Victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97647;Emperor Meiji has been restored to rule over Japan. An imperial messenger has arrived at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ palace in $CAPITAL$ to demand our willing allegiance to the Emperor.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97648;A New Capital in the East?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97648;While Kyoto has long been the capital of Japan, and home to the Imperial Court, the city of Edo has become the de facto capital-- for centuries it has been the center of shogunate power, as well as a cultural and administrative center. The Emperor will need to decide whether the court should move to Edo and create a new capital... or remain in Kyoto and revitalize it instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97650;We Are Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97650;The Imperial palace at Kyoto has been occupied, and our daimyo allies are on the retreat. Our advisors tell us that our only option is to lay down our arms and allow the Shogun his victory. If we are fortunate, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ clan will not be wiped out by this unfortunate turn of events.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97651;Tokugawa Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97651;Tokugawa clan forces have marched triumphantly into Kyoto, and the traitor daimyos have agreed to a permanent peace. The Bakumatsu has ended with the shogunate in control once again-- victory is ours!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97652;The Tokugawa shogunate has once again asserted control over Japan. A bakufu messenger has arrived at the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ palace in $CAPITAL$ to demand our submission to direct rule from Edo.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97605;More 'black ships' have appeared off our shores, these ones commanded by an American named Commodore Matthew Perry. The ill-tempered westerner is demanding an end to the Japanese policy of Sokoku-- specifically trading rights in several ports, extraterritoriality for American sailors and protection for their shipwrecks. At first he demanded to negotiate with the Emperor, but that is impossible. Thus it falls to the Shogun to either agree to his demands, risking the appearance of weakness, or refuse and bring the wrath of the Americans upon us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97660;The Korean Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97660;Many advisors within the government have stated that Korea presents a problem for Japan's security, and a recent rebellion in Korea shows how vulnerable they are. An invasion of the islands from the Korean mainland is a definite possibility, and in order to protect ourselves we should consider an invasion to set up a Korean protectorate. This will, of course, cause friction with the Chinese-- but why should we allow that to stand in the way of our protection? Many consider the Chinese themselves to be a severe threat.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97665;The Satsuma Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97665;A growing dissatisfaction among the former samurai with the abolition of the han system and the resulting reduction in their personal prestige has crystallized in a rebellion. Led by one of the most prestigious samurai leaders of the former Satsuma Domain, Saigo Takamori, the rebellion has attracted a large number of followers and will be a severe challenge for the Japanese government to deal with.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME97670;The Northern Islands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97670;The islands of Sakhalin and the Kurils are a natural extension of our holdings on Hokkaido, and we must seek to claim these places before the Russians do so first.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC97700;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots have risen up in $FROMCOUNTRY$, and have gained control of the capital. They send word they wish to bring all our lost provinces back to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control. Agreeing would mean risking war, but refusing would mean angering our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98007;Hungarian Revolutionaries;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98007;There has been general discontent among the Hungarians, and a group of young revolutionaries have appeared to demand a number of concessions including freedom of the press. Giving them even that will not satisfy them completely, but it might give the government time to put down this rebellion before it begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98008;Czech Radicals Attempt Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98008;A group of Czech radical democrats attempted to overthrow the government in a coup. They were unsuccessful, but their actions have inspired their countrymen to rise up in demand of freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98100;The Ladder Conspiracy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98100;The treatment of slaves in Cuba has become increasingly harsh after recent unrest, culminating in the so-called 'Ladder Conspiracy' which relates to a method of torture involving tying a slave to a ladder and whipping them until they confess or die. Reformists in the colony have been calling for a change in Spanish policy and an end to the slave trade there. Failure to do so could result in more uprisings, but bowing to such pressure could have serious repercussions back home.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98105;The Cry of Yara;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98105;Cuban sugar mill owner Carlos Manuel de Céspedes has issued the 'Grito de Yara', the 'Cry of Yara', declaring Cuban independence from $COUNTRY$ and freedom for his slaves. The man has many followers, and his call has spread rapidly throughout the colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98200;The Great Boer Trek;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98200;The Boers are descendants of Dutch settlers in the eastern Cape Colony, and they have never sat well with British rule. More and more of them are leaving their farmsteads and moving to the east and the northeast, encroaching on territory traditionally ruled by the Xhosa and the Basotho. Conflict with those native peoples appears to be inevitable, as perhaps is conflict with the Boers themselves should we allow any lands they claim to remain independent. As far as the British government is concerned, the Boers are British subjects... no matter where they go.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98205;Invasion of the Laagers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98205;The Boers are eager to get away from British rule, slowly leaving the lands of the Cape Colony and heading both east and north into the African wilds. The ones heading east are encroaching on Zulu territory, however, and it seems there is no end to them. They possess firearms, but we have the superior manpower... and all our chiefs agree on one thing: if we do not do something about the Boers now, they will dominate our territory and turn the Zulu people into colonial subjects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98206;The Battle of Blood River;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98206;The Boer encroachment into Zulu lands has provoked a reaction: the Battle of Blood River, prompted by the massacre of Piet Retief and his fellow pioneers after they attempted to negotiate borders for the new Natal settlement. The Voortrekkers won a decisive victory at the battle, and have now carved out a new colony-- with the only question remaining whether the British will recognize their independence or continue to treat them as subjects of the crown. Either way, further conflict seems certain.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98207;The Natalia Republic;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98207;The Boers which have trekked eastward into Zulu lands have reached a surprising settlement with the natives: they have staked out permanent borders for their new colony, and done so in relative peace. The real question remains whether we will allow this new Natalia Republic to stand. The Boers are British subjects, after all, and their existence will no doubt draw more Boers to their side... perhaps providing a threat to our African ambitions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98210;British Rule of Natal;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98210;The Boers of Natalia are once again chafing under British rule, resenting the idea that even though they left the Cape Colony they have not escaped the British crown. There have been several altercations with British military foces, and the recommendation of the colonial government is that Natal be annexed before the situation grows worse. If we do not, then we must allow the Boers to find their own way-- and suffer the loss to our prestige this would entail.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98211;Natalian Independence!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98211;After a series of altercations between British colonial forces and the Boer militia, the British crown has decided to cut its losses and allow Natal its independence. Finally we will control our own destiny, away from the British now and forever!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98212;The Annexation of Natalia;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98212;After a series of altercations between British colonial forces and the Boer militia, we have received a demand from the British government that Natalia be annexed into the Cape Colony. For all our struggles to leave the British behind, they yet follow us and refuse to allow us independence! So now we are faced with a choice: submit and move on, to find a place beyond their reach once more, or defy them and risk war.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98213;The Boers Have Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98213;We have received word from the Natalian government defying our annexation. Now we must either go to war or stand down in humiliation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98215;The Orange River Sovereignty;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98215;The Boers have been slowly trekking north from the Cape Colony into areas normally claimed by the Basotho.

The massive influx of foreign residents to the area is causing trouble along our borders and friction between our governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98236;Kimberley Goldrush;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98236;Gold has been discovered in the Kimberley province, leading to claims from both the Transvaal and Oranje governments that the region rightfully belongs to them. Mediation by the colonial government has led to Kimberley being awarded to the griquas-- who have subsequently consented to annexation by $COUNTRY$. This has led to considerable bad blood between the Boer and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governments.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98240;The South African Union ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98240;The time has come to consider joining the South African union. ;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98241;Appeal From $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98241;We have been approached by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats desperate for help in their war. Though they are loathe to do so, they are asking for $COUNTRY_ADJ$ protection. If we provide it, it does mean we establish an excellent claim over their territory.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98245;Annexation of the Transvaal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98245;Our colonial governor in South Africa declared an annexation of the Transvaal via special warrant several years ago, one that the Boers have stubbornly resisted. Both Transvaal and the Oranje Free State have considerable resources which would be of value to $COUNTRY$, and we must consider the idea that keeping them out of the hands of competitors for African dominance is just as much reason to annex them as using those resources for our ourselves. The Boer resistance has proven embarrasing. If we do not answer this with force, it will make the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ look weak to the world.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98246;The Anglo-Boer War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98246;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have gone to war with the Transvaal, and many Boers are fearful that $COUNTRY$ will surely be next. They are crying out to our government to ally with the Transvaalis and stop the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ from taking away their lands and their rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98247;South Africa is Lost;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98247;The Boers have proven far more resilient than we ever would have thought possible, and now we face the humiliating prospect of surrendering the Cape Colony to them. It seems we have little choice, with the war going so badly and Cape Town already occupied. All we can do is decide whether we will pursue a conciliatory path with the Boers and perhaps make them future allies or aim at returning in the future and reclaiming what has been lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98248;The Treaty of Vereeniging;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98248;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent negotiators to work out the terms of their surrender. The tone is one of reconciliation, and it is clear the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ wishes to build good relations with us after the business of this war is done.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98249;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent negotiators to work out the terms of their surrender. The tone of the talks has been very bitter, and it's clear the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government will do all it can to return and trouble us again in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98250;Border Dispute with the Zulu;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98250;The Zulus have slaughtered a $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regiment that entered their territory without our authority. While we had not been seeking a war with the Zulus, now our hand is forced. We must either back down and apologize, or see this through to the bitter end.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98255;Conflict with the Xhosa;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98255;Once again, conflict with the native Xhosa has flared into violence in our Cape Colony. A band of Xhosa warriors spilled across the border, stealing cattle and burning down a host of British farmsteads. Colonial citizens are demanding that the governor take action.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98256;The Final Straw;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98256;We have received reports from the Cape Colony that there has been yet another outbreak of violence between the Xhosa natives and the colonials. This time it is evidently caused by natives returning from the diamond mines, attempting to take back control of their lands without any consideration for due process. Many within the Cape Colony believe it is time that the military moved in and took over their lands completely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98260;Walvis Bay;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98260;Other European nations are eyeing the region of Namaqualand, directly to the north of our holdings in the Cape Colony. To forestall their ambitions, it has been recommended that we establish an enclave at Walvis Bay and incorporate it into our southern colony.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98261;The Northern Cape Colony;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98261;Many British settlers are pushing north of the Cape Colony into areas only tenuously claimed by our government. We should consider increasing our presence in the region and establishing greater colonial government, before another country comes and claims it instead.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98300;War-Time Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98300;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, the people are all too keenly aware that the nation exists in a state of war. Debates in $CAPITAL$ rage over the state of the war, though the overwhelming feeling is that now more than ever citizens should be supporting the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. Still, there are some who believe that now is the perfect time for change.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98301;Violent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98301;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election begins, there is a general sense that things are not going to proceed smoothly. A sense of change is in the air, and while not everyone wants that change it seems there are many who have leapt upon the election as a chance to make it happen. A recent riot in $CAPITAL$ was only barely kept under control, and debates elsewhere in $COUNTRY$ are threatening to erupt into further violence as neither side is willing to budge.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98302;Anger Against the Government;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98302;$COUNTRY$ has its share of problems-- and as the current election gets underway, there is a sense among many that the current government is to blame. Justified or not, that anger has instilled a sense that a regime change may be in the offing. Those who previously had never considered voting for any other party than the one in power are now considering doing just that.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98303;Contentious Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98303;As the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election gets underway, it becomes clear it will be a contentious one. The issues are clear and the battle lines between parties drawn, and there are those who believe that while violence may not be the result the toppling of the current $COUNTRY_ADJ$ regime could be.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98304;Government Supporters Rally;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98304;With the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election underway, supporters of the current regime have rallied in $CAPITAL$. They claim that stability is required to deal with the problems facing $COUNTRY$, and are actively trying to shout down opposition. Whether this will mean a victory in the current election is unknown.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98305;Orderly Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98305;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election is underway, and so far has proceeded smoothly. Debates are being carried out in the usual manner, and there are no reports of violence in $CAPITAL$ or elsewhere. Supporters of the ruling regime have turned out in force, as have the hopefuls seeking to defeat the current government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME98310;Conservatives Declare Victory!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC98310;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election has ended, with the leader of the conservative party declaring victory from the steps of the presidential palace in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC98311;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ election has ended, with the leader of the socialist party declaring victory from the steps of the presidential palace in $CAPITAL$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME1316081;The Kowloon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316081;A drunken riot by a large group of British sailors ashore at Kowloon has resulted in the death of a local man. By rights, the sailors should be tried and executed by the Qing magistrate. The British, however, have demanded extraterritoriality-- meaning their citizens would be tried by British judges. This will inevitably lead to their release and the anger of our citizens, but demanding these mens' executions could lead to war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1316082;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316082;The war with $FROMCOUNTRY$ is not going well. These damnable foreigners are in our lands and blockading our ports, and to the embarassment of our government there seems to be little we can do to stop them. $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have approached us to negotiate a 'fair' settlement. While we could drag the war on and see if the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have the wherewithal to finish their assault, it might be in our best interest to give them a concession port and reparations. Indeed, this might even help us in some ways, though the loss to our prestige would be considerable.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1316083;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316083;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ rulership has signed our peace treaty, granting us a concession port on their coast as well as reparations. This has improved relations between our countries tremendously, and should go a long way to ensuring $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in China remains strong.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1316084;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has Refused!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1316084;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have refused to submit. The war must go on.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131709;The Kowloon Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131709;An incident that began with drunken sailors murdering a Chinese man has escalated into a larger crisis with the Qing government. We have insisted that these sailors be tried by a British judge-- the barbaric Chinese judicial system would result in these men getting anything but a fair trial. The chinese have demanded the men be turned over, and what's more that they be given the right to punish British citizens as needed. The confrontation has resulted in larger trade sanctions being applied against British merchants, and threats of worse. Our prestige as an Empire to be reckoned with is being threatened.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131710;The Unequal Treaty;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131710;In a display of diplomatic force, $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have forced $COUNTRY$ to sign a treaty with them, forcing numerous trade as well as territory concessions.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131711;The Simla Convention;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131711;British diplomats have approached the Tibet government, hoping to broker a peaceful arrangement between Tibet and China now that Tibet is independent. No doubt they intend to gain influence and territory in our nation, as well as an ally against Chinese aggression,, but the prospect of war should the negotiations fail seems likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

No doubt they intend to gain influence and territory in Tibet, as well as an ally against $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aggression,, but the prospect of war should the negotiations fail seems likely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131713;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Agreed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131713;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have agreed to the arrangements made at the Simla Convention, and our relations with them have improved as a result-- not to mention our prestige.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131714;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131714;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have refused the arrangements made at the Simla Convention, and our relations with them have cooled as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131715;The New Army;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131715;Our efforts to modernize the Beiyang army have borne fruit, but this has necessitated the division of authority among regional forces. The generals in charge of these forces, 'warlords' as some call them, have been gaining a great deal of power. They are part of the Beiyang Army, but fight amongst themselves... And, far worse, are critical of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government. We will need to watch these generals carefully.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131720;Spread of Anhui Influence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131720;Warlord influence has begun to spread into $STATENAME$. These generals are still loyal to $COUNTRY$, but it is becoming increasingly apparent that they are taking control of a significant portion of the country. Officials in $CAPITAL$ are alarmed.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME131730;The Warlord Era;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131730;Resistance against the $CAPITAL$ government has culminated in a breakdown in authority. What began with several of the outlying warlords declaring their indepedence has ended with the most powerful generals in the Beiyang Army struggling for control. A contest has begun regarding who will control the future of China's destiny, and most are certain it will not be long before the entire nation is engulfed in war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131735;The Struggle for China;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131735;Now that we are free, we must choose where we stand in the ensuing struggle for the nation's destiny: either side with the Kuomintang and fight for domination of the republic or side with the Beiyang and fight for domination of a united China. Alternatively, we can declare our neutrality in the conflict and let the chips fall where they may.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131736;The Guominjun Clique;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131736;A $COUNTRY_ADJ$ general by the name of Feng Yuxiang has betrayed his superiors and broken off from the Beiyang armies. He and his supporters have taken the territory under their control and formed a new clique, swearing to topple the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131740;Leader of the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131740;The leaders of the Kuomintang are preparing for their drive on Beijing, and $COUNTRY$ is expected to answer the call. Either we side with Nationalist China now, or we must abandon the Kuomintang cause and seek our own destiny.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131741;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Joins the Kuomintang;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131741;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has answered the call, and will unite their forces with ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131742;The War of Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131742;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people are crying out for the nation to once again unify. We must gather our strength and strike out at those who would divide China, leaving it weak for foreigners to prey upon. Already the banners are in the streets, and $COUNTRY$'s generals are saying now is the time to launch an offensive.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131743;War with $FROMCOUNTRY$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131743;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ army is massing on our mutual border, ready to make a massive offensive into $COUNTRY_ADJ$ territory. It seems a war is upon us, whether we like it or not: either they destroy us or we destroy them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131745;Chinese Reunification;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131745;The call has come from the capital: the era of warlords is over, and all the Chinese peoples must unite under a single flag. This means $COUNTRY$ must either submit to Beijing's rule or face more war against a strong and unified foe. Your generals stand ready to receive your command.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME131746;The Island of Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC131746;Now that we own the island of Formosa, the local Min population has begun to organize itself-- presumably towards the end of breaking away from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME142501_sub;Slavery Debated in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC142501;A major abolutionist running for office in $STATENAME$ has challenged his slave-holding rival to a debate, which has drawn a great deal of attention in the current $COUNTRY_ADJ$ elections.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME142601;A Step Too Far;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME142601_sub;Slavery Debate Turns Violent!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC142601;A debate being held in $STATENAME$ prompted a riot when arguments being made about slavery prompted anger by abolitionists in the crowd. So far no arrests have been made, but people on both sides of the debate have been calling for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government to step in and punish those responsible.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160001;The Taiping Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160001;The followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' have finally risen in rebellion against Imperial rule. A peasant army has been organized by the rebels Feng Yunshan and Wei Changhui, followers of Hong Xiuquan, and have actually managed to defeat the Imperial garrisons and drive out the local governors. These Christians are driven to topple the Qing Dynasty and led by a madman... we must act quickly, before this rebellion succeeds and proves to the rest of China that the Mandate of Heaven no longer rests with the Manchu.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160002;Taiping Rebellion Defeated;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160002;We have crushed the 'Heavenly Kingdom', and proven to all of China that the Qing Dynasty yet maintains the Mandate of Heaven. We will abide no more insurrections.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160003;Taiping Rebellion Victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160003;Even though we are not yet done with the 'Heavenly Kingdom', the fact the rebels have forced us to a ceasefire and have not been crushed is being taken by our Chinese subjects as a sign of weakness. Officials are predicting rebellions in many other places in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160006;The War Against Taiping;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160006;The continued existence of the Taiping rebels is an embarassment to the Qing government and our Emperor. Calls have been made for the war to resume, and this time for a national effort be started to draft men into the Qing army. There will be considerable resistance, but the Emperor has decreed that the Heavenly Kingdom must be destroyed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160007:The War Against the Manchu;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160007;The truce with the Qing Emperor has come to an end, and already the calls have begun for the Taiping Revolution to continue. The Manchu must be thrown down! All of China must be freed!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160011;The Female Shortage;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160011;Due to the low value assigned to the birth of daughters, female infanticide has become wide-spread across much of China. The practice has become so common, in fact, it has led to a shortage of women.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160501;Missionaries in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160501;Christian missionaries are stirring up trouble in southern China, handing out pamphlets in an effort to gain converts. This would not be so objectionable were the pamphlet not also preaching sedition against the Qing Dynasty. The fact that so many in $PROVINCENAME$ are willing to listen to these fools is worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME160502;Anti-Manchu Sentiment;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC160502;To many people in China, the Qing Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south. This is especially true in $PROVINCENAME$, where there are reports of rioting after a recent confrontation between locals and Manchu officials.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME162503;The Taiping Sect Spreads!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC162503;The followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' have infested yet another province. According to officials in $PROVINCENAME$, followers of Hong Xiuquan have been spotted and sentiment against the Qing Dynasty is on the rise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME164503;The Heavenly Kingdom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC164503;A troublemaker has arisen in the southern lands. According to reports, this man claims to have received a vision to the effect that he is the younger brother of Jesus Christ and was sent to rid China of the corrupt Manchu Qing Dynasty rulers. He has been winning converts to Christianity, and it seems there are many willing to listen to his words of sedition and join his so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME164504;Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC164504;The man behind the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has been given a name: Hong Xiuquan. A former farmer who attempted the civil service examinations in Guangzhou and failed, he has now become a charismatic visionary taking advantage of anti-Manchu sentiment in the south. Some say he is crazed and mad, but regardless he is a danger to the Qing Dynasty and his words are finding eager ears.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME164505;Yang Xiuqing;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC164505;Reports have arrived at the palace that a firewood seller has taken to walking the Southlands, claiming to speak with the voice of God. Regardless of his seeming madness, the man has proven very effective at spreading the word of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME164599;The Xinhai Revolution;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC164599;The forces of revolution have turned against the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ Emperor. With dissent threatening to spread into chaos, leaders of the Beiyang army have demanded the Emperor abdicate his throne. Cheering crowds in $CAPITAL$ greeted the news, but few are aware of the forces now lining up to take control of the government. Kuomintang revolutionaries have demanded a transformation of $COUNTRY$ into a republic with free elections. Army leaders, however, have threatened to oppose the Kuomintang and demanded the republic be under strict Beiyang control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME164600;The Tongmenghui;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC164600;Revolutionary societies are springing up all over China, and recently we have received word that several of these societies have banded together as the Tongmenghui or 'Chinese United League'. Their stated goal is the revival of Zhonghua, or the concept that China should be a nation ruled by a republic that represents all of its various peoples. These revolutionaries wish to see $COUNTRY$ freed of foreigner influence, and do not seem satisifed to wait and see what reforms the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy will provide. What's more worrying is that some of the regional warlords appear to be assisting them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME164601;Revolutionary Uprising in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC164601;Revolutionaries seeking to bring down the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy have been stirring up a revolt in $STATENAME$. The incident appears to have begun in $PROVINCENAME$, after a demonstration by local workers turned violent. Though authorities have already moved in, the damage is done. What remains is to determine how we react to this outrageous provocation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1605020;The Death of Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1605020;After a period of self-enforced isolation, Hong Xiuquan has died-- some say of poison, others of illness. Regardless of the cause, the nation has been thrown into mourning for their beloved leader. Hong Xiuquan's son, Hong Tianguifu, is ready to step into his father's role as leader, but there are some who fear he will be unsuitable. They are advocating a restoration of the Qing dynasty. Others say that $COUNTRY$ must become a republic, in emulation of western powers. Whether $COUNTRY$ is ready for such a change is difficult to say.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME1605021;Retreat to Formosa;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC1605021;With our holdings on the mainland lost, all we have left is our stronghold on the island of Formosa. The suggestion among what little remains of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government is that we abandon $CAPITAL$ and move the capital to Taibei. This does not guarantee our safety by any means, but it may be the only means of survival we possess.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800050;The Power of Tradition;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800050;Reactionary elements have taken over the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, and their influence is felt both here and abroad.

EVTDESC800055;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ goverment has been overthrown, and the rebel government has declared themselves free from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule.

EVTNAME800056;Rebellion in our ally!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800056;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has been toppled, and the rebels blame $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence as one of the primary causes of the old regime's corruption. We have lost our influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ as a result, and the only question that remains is whether we wish to press our claim by force.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800060;The Proletariat Cause;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800060;An opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of communism in a neighboring state.

EVTNAME800064;We Were Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME800065;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800065;We have reports of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ propaganda being spread in one of our border provinces. Clearly the $FROMCOUNTRY$ government does not respect our sovereignty.

EVTDESC800076;An envoy has arrived from $FROMCOUNTRY$, offering to hold a summit in their capital to bring our two great powers closer together.

EVTNAME800078;$COUNTRY_ADJ$-$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ Summit of $YEAR$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800078;The summit in $CAPITAL$ unfortunately failed to make any significant progress.

EVTDESC800084;A violent incident has occurred at one of the foreign embassies in $CAPITAL$, spurred on by resentment towards their nation and its ideological hostility towards our communist regime.

EVTDESC800089;A violent incident has occurred at our embassy in $FROMCOUNTRY$, spurred on by $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ resentment towards $COUNTRY$ and our ideology.

EVTNAME800090;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Does Not Accept;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800090;Despite our apology, the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has declared it is enraged by the incident and that our lack of control over our citizens is to blame. While they are seen as being unreasonably aggressive, war is even a possibility.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800091;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Accepts;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800091;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has accepted our apology for the incident, and while our relations have been damaged the incident has mostly blown over.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800092;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Enraged;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800092;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ leaders have declared our actions outrageous, and that the incident was no doubt secretly supported by our government. They claim this provides them ample grounds for war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800093;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Backs Down;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800093;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has backed down from escalating the incident into a war. The entire business has harmed relations between our nations.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC800098;Several of our country's citizens have been attacked in the capital of $FROMCOUNTRY$, an incident spurred on by the severe differences between our country's ideology and their's. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ has been extremely reluctant to admit any involvement in the affair, and our relations have been hurt as a result.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800099;Nationalist Victory;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800099;Nationalist rebels have successfully seceded from $COUNTRY$. Their young nation, however, is still very much in chaos and vulnerable to attack. Their leaders have approached the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government, hopeful for a reconciliation now that they have proven their mettle. It falls to us to decide if we will recognize the loss of territory, and perhaps gain an ally, or fight to retake what we have lost.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800100;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Patriots;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800100;We have been contacted by $COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots, currently living under the dominion of a neighboring country. They suggest that there is an opportunity to stir up sentiment among those living there so that they may rise up and rejoin the mother country. There is, of course, a risk that our efforts could be discovered and bring war down upon us. Should we help them?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800101;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Spreading Dissent;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800101;We have received reports that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has been inciting dissent among minorities in $COUNTRY$. This is an act of aggression that deserves a swift response.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME800111;A Royal Wedding;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800111;Several ministers have suggested that one of the royal heirs is old enough to be married. Though it would be better to seek out a candidate from the royal families of neighboring countries, the ministers have concluded that there is no-one suitable. They have, however, found a member of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocracy who fits the bill.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800112;An Heir Is Born!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTNAME800115;Questioning the Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800115;There has been some open questioning of the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ monarchy, with some citizens apparently believing the time has come to move to a more democratic form of government.

EVTNAME800121;Powers of the Monarchy;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800121;There has been increasing question as of late as to the amount of power the monarchy has in $COUNTRY$. Many prominent citizens have been speaking out publicly in favor of allowing different parties to partake in the government and provide alternate points of view.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800122;Voting Rights;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800122;Word has reached the royal council that a number of prominent citizens are clamoring for greater freedom to vote. There are, however, still others who believe the monarchy has extended too many freedoms as it is.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800123;The Old Guard;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800123;The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ aristocracy has never been in favor of change, and with the rise of liberal attitudes there are those in elite circles who feel that something needs to be done. A cabal of old guard aristocrats has formed, with the reported goal of ensuring that traditional values be maintained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800147;Sepoy Rebels Force Concessions;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800147;The Indian subcontinent has been overwhelmed by the Sepoy rebels. Our garrisons are in retreat, and our colonial governors have already fled for safer ports. We have no choice but to give into their demands, many of which involve removing $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence from any of the nations we have subjugated over the years of our rule.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800148;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Driven Out of South Asia;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800148;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ presence in South Asia has come to an end, thanks to the spread of the Sepoy Rebellion.

EVTNAME800149;Rebels Storm $CAPITAL$!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800149;After a swarm of violence and looting that engulfed the entire nation, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rioters have stormed the capital. The government has been forced to make numerous concessions, in a desperate bid to calm the people. So far it seems to have worked, and has spared many leaders from being executed by angry mobs, but it remains to be seen whether these concessions will only cause more problems in the end than they solved.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800150;Pan-Nationalists Victorious!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800150;Pan-nationalist rebels demanding a greater $UNION_ADJ$ union have taken over $CAPITAL$, and have begun spreading the idea of $COUNTRY$ becoming part of $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$ no matter the cost to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800151;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ Patriots;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800151;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ patriots have risen up in a neighboring country, and have gained sufficient control that they have sent word they wish to bring the province back to $COUNTRY$. Agreeing would mean risking war, but refusing would mean angering our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME800152;Provinces Brought Under Control;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC800152;With the patriot rebellion now over, our provinces have now been brought under control and $COUNTRY_ADJ$ governors are once again in command.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999034;The Anarcho-Liberals;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999034;It looks like the anarcho liberals, a group of radicals who have taken the liberal ideals to their extreme, have discovered a talent in the current election to find the right words when and where they are needed: All over $COUNTRY$ their new agenda has persuaded a lot of people to join their cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999035;The Social Liberals;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999035;A new breed of $COUNTRY_ADJ$ liberals has become very active in the current election-- educated liberals who believe equally in both social and political reform. They have been actively campaigning for people to support both, and have been attracting a lot of attention.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999036;Reactionary Surge;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999036;There are a large number of people, particularly among the ruling elite of $COUNTRY$, who believe that liberal attitudes have been responsible for all of the country's ills. They advocate controls on immigration and a repeal of voting rights. They also appear to have charismatic speakers, for they seem to be gathering a lot of attention in the current election.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999037;Surge of Conservatism;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC999055;A recent mine accident that led to the deaths of five children, all labourers working under the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ child labor laws, has led to a national debate over the issue. Children wearing protest signs have shown up at political debates, causing quite a stir and raising the question over whether the government should consider reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999056;The Rights of Minorities;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999056;A demonstration by minorities in $CAPITAL$, denouncing the fact that 'universal suffrage' in $COUNTRY$ does not include them, has drawn attention throughout the country and sparked debates over whether minorities should be given the right to vote. Reactionaries are incensed at the idea, claiming that only 'true' $COUNTRY_ADJ$ citizens should decide its government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999057;The Immigration Issue;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999057;Immigration has long been a thorny issue in $COUNTRY$, with many citizens maintaining the opinion that allowing too many foreigners into the country leads to chaos and unemployment. $COUNTRY$ should be for the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people, and no others. Despite this, the plight of immigrants who are longing to be reunited with family currently located elsewhere has received a great deal of attention in the current election. There have been demonstrations by liberals in $CAPITAL$ calling for immigration reform.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999060;War Dominates the Election;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999060;So far the war has dominated talk in the election, with a number of jingoistic politicians rousing the people with fiery speeches. 'We must protect $COUNTRY$!', they cry. '$COUNTRY$ must be mighty!' It seems they are being listened to, as so far they have enjoyed success throughout the country.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999061;Talk of War;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999061;While $COUNTRY$ is not currently at war, there are those who think it should be. 'They are ripe for the picking, and $COUNTRY$ must strike now! While we are strong!' They are referring to one of our hated neighbours, who some jingoists feel should be a target for expansion. Permitting such talk will make us look aggressive to the international community, however, though it may also be an opportunity of which to take advantage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

EVTDESC11380019;In a surprise election win, the fascists have taken power in the government. Technically they are allowed to do so, and their party has not been banned.

Some are even suggesting the possibility of voter fraud. Regardless, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ people have spoken... and the monarchy must decide whether to intervene and refuse the fascists their mandate as many expect. Failure to intervene means admitting that they have no power and thus relinquishing all control over the government.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

peking_convention_TPG_desc;Since the Treaty of Nerchinsk (1689), the Russian Empire has recognized the Argun river and the Stanovoy mountains as the natural frontiers between Russia and China.  In the mid 19th century the Russians would expand beyond this border to seize the vast lands between the Stanovoy Mountains and the Amur River. The Western Allies would later bring the Second Opium War to a conclusion by burning the Chinese Emperor's summer palaces, and entering Beijing. A cunning major general named Nikolay Ignatiev was able to convinced the Chinese that only Russian support would cause the allies to evacuate Peking. The price for this support was the Convention of Peking, which confirmed Muravyov's gains and, additionally, ceded territory between the Ussuri River and the Pacific to Russia. Thus, Russia had gained some 350,000 square miles of territory without firing a single shot.;Depuis le traité de Nerchinsk (1689), lEmpire russe a reconnu le fleuve Argun et les monts Stanovoy comme frontière naturelle entre la Russie et la Chine.  Au cours du XIXe siècle, les Russes franchirent cette frontière pour semparer des vastes territoires entre les monts Stanovoy et le fleuve Amour. Les Puissances occidentales mirent plus tard un terme à la seconde guerre de lopium en brûlant les palais dété de lempereur et en semparant de Pékin. Un général russe avisé du nom de Nicolaï Ignatiev parvint à convaincre les chinois que seul le soutien de la Russie permettrait l'évacuation de Pékin par les alliés. Le prix de ce soutien fut la convention de Pékin, qui entérinait les conquêtes de Muravyov et cédait à la Russie les territoires entre le fleuve Ussuri et la côte pacifique. Ainsi, la Russie gagna-t-elle 560 000 kilomètres carrés sans tirer un coup de fusil.;Seit dem Vertrag von Nertschinsk (1689) hatte das russische Reich den Fluss Argun und das Stanowoigebirge als natürliche Grenze zwischen Russland und China betrachtet. Mitte des 19. Jahrhunderts wollten die Russen diese Grenze erweitern, um das weiträumige Gebiet zwischen dem Stanowoigebirge und dem Fluss Amur zu annektieren. Später beendeten die westlichen Alliierten den zweiten Opiumkrieg durch Niederbrennen der Sommerpaläste des chinesischen Kaisers und marschierten in Peking ein. Der gerissene Generalmajor Nikolai Ignatjew konnte die Chinesen überzeugen, dass sie die Westmächte nur mit russischer Unterstützung zum Abzug bewegen können würden. Der Preis für diese Unterstützung war die Pekinger Konvention, die Murawjows Forderungen bestätigte und Russland zusätzlich noch das Territorium zwischen dem Fluss Ussuri und dem Pazifik zusprach. Russland hatte sich also einen Gebietsgewinn von 350000 Quadratmeilen verschafft, ohne einen einzigen Schuss dafür abzufeuern.;;Desde el tratado de Nerchinsk (1689), el imperio ruso siempre había reconocido el río Argun y la cordillera de Stanovoy como fronteras naturales entre Rusia y China.  A mediados del siglo XIX, los rusos se expandirían más allá de esta frontera para apoderarse de los vastos territorios situados entre las montañas Stanovoy y el río Amur. Más adelante, los países occidentales pondrían fin a la Segunda Guerra del Opio incendiando los palacios estivales del emperador de China y ocupando Pekín. Un astuto general llamado Nikolay Ignatiev logró convencer a los chinos de que solo el apoyo de Rusia obligaría a los aliados a evacuar la capital. El precio de este apoyo fue la convención de Pekín, donde se confirmaron las ganancias obtenidas por Muravyov y, además, China cedió a Rusia nuevos territorios entre el río Ussuri y el Pacífico. De este modo, Rusia adquirió unas 350.000 millas cuadradas de territorio sin tener que disparar un solo tiro.;;;;;;;;;x
