EVTNAME90007;Hungarian Revolutionaries;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90007;There has been general discontent among the Hungarians, and a group of young revolutionaries have appeared to demand a number of concessions including freedom of the press. Giving them even that will not satisfy them completely, but it might give the government time to put down this rebellion before it begins.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME90008;Czech Radicals Attempt Coup;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90008;A group of Czech radical democrats attempted to overthrow the government in a coup. They were unsuccessful, but their actions have inspired their countrymen to rise up in demand of freedom.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME90009;The Schleswig-Holstein Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90009;Schleswig-Holstein is of vital interest to the German peoples. Now that Prussia has taken control, several members of Austria's German sphere have urged us to demand that the Prussian government co-operate in the region's administration. Failure to do so will cause a significant loss of influence.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTNAME90011;The Schleswig-Holstein Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90011;The question of Schleswig-Holstein's independence is of interest to the German people. Now that $COUNTRY$ has taken control, $FROMCOUNTRY$ has approached and demanded that administration of the region be decided by their government as well as ours.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME90012;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Refused;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90012;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has stated it refuses to negotiate over the question of Schleswig-Holstein.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTNAME90013;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Released Schleswig-Holstein;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90013;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has agreed to release Schleswig-Holstein, but we notice that it retains massive influence in their government while excluding our own. This is clearly an attempt to provoke us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME90014;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Has Relented;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90014;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has agreed to release Schleswig-Holstein as an independant nation under both our influence. Our negotiations have been a success.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTNAME90015;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Loses Face;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90015;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has bent knee over the question of Schleswig-Holstein's administration. It is clear to many in $COUNTRY$ they do not have what it takes to lead the larger German confederation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTNAME90016;Archduke Ferdinand Assassinated;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90016;One of the most prominent members of Austrian aristocracy has been murdered by a Serbian assassin, a member of a group of nationalists who seek to rejoin with the Serbian nation. There are definite suspicions that the Serbian government has been secretly helping these nationalists and is behind the event.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME90017;The Hungarian Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90017;With the recent unrest in Hungarian lands, the local Hungarian government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME90018;The Lombardy Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

EVTNAME90050;The Annexation of Schleswig;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90050;The duchies of Schleswig and Holstein have long been united and considered indivisible under the Danish crown, but a question of royal claim to the duchies combined with the Holsteinian desire to join in the larger German Confederation to the south has led to considerable difficulty for King Frederick VII. The treatment of Danish people in Schleswig living under Holsteinian domination has led to a call for the duchy to be incorporated into $COUNTRY$ proper. This is unlikely to be looked on favorably by the conservative German aristocracy in Holstein.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME90051;The Annexation of Schleswig;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90051;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ crown wishes to annex the Duchy of Schleswig, which has long been considered indivisible from the Duchy of Holstein. The German aristocracy is enraged by this move. They believe their future lies with the German Confederation to the south, but the Duke of Augustenberg has a stronger claim to Schleswig than the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ King. Schleswig-Holstein must forge its own path, even if it means war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTNAME90052;Schleswig-Holstein Under Our Control;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90052;Now that order has been restored to Schleswig-Holstein, international pressure is mounting to uphold treaties regarding the region. Failure to restore nominal independence to the duchies and keep them united will result in tensions between $COUNTRY$ and other European powers, and possibly war with the German Confederation to the south.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME90053;The November Constitution;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90053;King Frederick VII has died and left no heir. According to the recently-drafted constitution, the crowns of both Denmark and Schleswig would pass to Duke Christian of Glücksburg. The crown of Holstein is more problematic, however. The House of Augustenburg claims the crowns of both Schleswig and Holstein and is calling on German support. If the new consitution is signed, Schleswig-Holstein will be officially divided. If it is not, the Danish people will almost certainly rise up against their new king.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90054;The Schleswig-Holstein Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90054;The arrogant German aristocrats in Holstein have declared they intend to pursue a future with the German Confederation to the south, and consider Schleswig an indivisible part of their territory. $COUNTRY_ADJ$ militants are angrily calling for the military to step in, though some fear this may lead to war with the Germans.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
