EVTNAME90025;Tunisian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90025;It has become increasingly obvious that the Tunisian government operates independently from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. We cannot continue to control them directly, and must either take measures to assert our dominance or allow them to seek their own path.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME90026;The Young Ottomans;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90026;A group of liberal intellectuals that were responsible for the reforms of the Kanûn-i Esâsî have begun stirring up resentment of the Ottoman autocracy. They demand to see the power of the throne reduced to that of a constitutional monarchy, though advisors note that giving into their demands will only anger reactionaries determined to see the Empire's traditions maintained.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

EVTNAME90029;Bulgarian Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90029;With the recent unrest in Bulgarian lands, the local Bulgarian government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME90030;Albanian Independence?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90030;With the recent unrest in Albanian lands, the local Albanian government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

EVTNAME90036;Freedom in the Balkans;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90036;The Ottomans continue their brutal oppression of Orthodox Christians in the Balkans. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has been receiving calls for assistance from dissidents within the Empire, and the feeling among our own Orthodox citizens is that we should take a stand to help our brothers of the faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME90060;The Eastern Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90060;The Ottoman Empire has been in slow decline for much of the last century, but never has this been more apparent than in recent years. The Empire's hold on the Balkans is weakening, and this threatens to upset the entire balance of power in Eastern Europe as Russia and other countries will inevitably be drawn into the conflict. Many in the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government feel that it falls on us to call the powers of Europe together and negotiate a settlement that will restore some semblance of stability to the area.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTNAME90061;Planning for the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90061;Now that plans for the conference in $CAPITAL$ are underway, $COUNTRY_ADJ$ statesmen are busy trying to determine what our stance on the issue should be. Some feel we should favor keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East. This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME90062;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90062;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of $COUNTRY$ to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel this is a veiled attempt to carve up our nation, and an insult, but regardless we cannot let the congress go on without our attendance. We shall see what manner of 'negotiation' $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTNAME90063;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90063;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel this is a veiled attempt to bolster the shaky Empire's hold over the Middle East and balk Russian 'aggression'. Either way, we cannot let the congress go on without our attendance. We shall see what manner of 'negotiation' $FROMCOUNTRY$ intends.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME90064;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Calls for Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90064;We have received word from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ that they intend to hold a congress of European powers in their capital to discuss the ability of the Ottomans to maintain stability in the Balkans. Some feel we should favor keeping the Ottoman Empire strong, in the interest of preventing the Russians from expanding into the Middle East. This could potentially improve our relations with the Ottomans, as well. Others believe stability in the Balkans should be the priority, even though this might come at the expense of the Ottomans and our relationship with them. Still others feel we should not take part in this veiled attempt at dismembering a sovereign nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME90065;The Congress of $CAPITAL$: Keep the Empire Strong;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90065;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that the Ottoman Empire needed to be kept strong, and any demands placed on it should not weaken its interests unduly. Few of the attendees were pleased, the Russians in particular, and even though the Congress favored the Ottomans it remains to be seen whether they will bow to European pressure and uphold the Congress's edict.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME90066;The Congress of $CAPITAL$: Stabilize the Balkans;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90066;The great powers of Europe joined together in $CAPITAL$ to negotiate the future of the Balkans, with delegates from the Ottoman Empire also in attendance. While there was much contention, ultimately it was decided that creating stability in the region was best even if it came at the expense of the Empire's power. The Russian delegates were pleased, but Ottoman delegates left in a rage. It remains to be seen whether they will bow before the Congress's demands.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME90067;The Demands of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90067;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with mixed news: though the consensus reached was that $COUNTRY$ needed to be kept strong, they still placed numerous demands upon us that would see the political map of the Balkans rearranged. If we choose to defy the European edict, we could be facing wars from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTNAME90068;The Demands of the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90068;Our delegates have returned from the Congress in $FROMCOUNTRY$ with disheartening news: despite considerable dissension among those attending, a consesus was reached that creating stability in the Balkans is more important that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests and sovereignty. The demands are humiliating, and will see us losing much of the Balkans if we agree. If we defy the Congress, however, we could be facing war from many fronts.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME90069;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees to the Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90069;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent word to the European powers that it will abide by the decrees of the Congress. This proves to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government they are serious about working with the rest of Europe to maintain stability.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME90070;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Agrees to the Demands;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90070;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has sent word to the European powers that it will abide by the decrees of the Congress. This proves to the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government they are serious about working with the rest of Europe to maintain stability, though it is clear they are angered by the results.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME90071;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Defies the Congress;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90071;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has decreed that it will not abide by the demands of the Congress. The Treaty, they say, is so much worthless paper, and they refuse to give up any of their sovereignty.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTNAME90075;The Fate of Egypt;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90075;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now it has become all too apparent, and a threat to the vision of the Ottoman Empire as master of the Orient... something which has been little more than an illusion, but which the Ottomans must either address or have it shattered forever. War will come, and Egypt will either be beaten back into place and made to heel at its master's side or seek its own destiny as a power in its own right. Only time will tell.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME90080;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90080;Egypt has been effectively independent for some time. Now that independence has become all too apparent, and Ottoman mastery over the Orient is threatened. Either we must take steps to rectify the situation, and assert our dominance once and for all, or admit to the world that our power is little more than an illusion. There are those who feel that a peaceful solution is possible, and that the Egyptians might better serve as powerful allies than as implacable enemies, but that would require us to surrender our claim to Egyptian lands as well as be an affront to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ pride.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTNAME90085;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90085;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Should the Egyptians successfully challenge Ottoman rule, it could upset the entire balance of power in the region... something that many feel would threaten $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests. Still others believe that $COUNTRY$ must remain neutral, despite the cost to our relations with the Empire.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME90086;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the Empire;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90086;We have received word through the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ embassy pledging their support for the Ottoman Empire in our conflict with the Egyptians. This is heartening news.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME90090;The Oriental Crisis;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90090;$COUNTRY_ADJ$ diplomats have been watching the crisis develop in the Orient for some time, and now that the Ottomans and Egyptians are at war it has become clear that the Empire's hold over its dominion is crumbling. Egyptian diplomats have contacted ours through channels, and suggested that support in its war would be appreciated and rewarded. The Ottomans, they rightfully point out, are after all no friends of $COUNTRY$. Such an act could earn us the enmity of the Empire and its allies, however, and thus feel we must remain neutral in the conflict despite the possible benefit to $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90091;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the Egyptians;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90091;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If something isn't done it could develop into an alliance between Egypt and $FROMCOUNTRY$ that could lead to their intervention in the war.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME90092;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Supports the Egyptians;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90092;We have received word that the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have pledged their support for the Egyptians in their conflict with the Ottoman Empire. If we do not object now, that support could lead to their intervention in the war. That objection, however, could also be seen as aggression on our part and harm our relations with $FROMCOUNTRY$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME90093;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Demands Withdrawal;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTDESC90093;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ have sent a demand through diplomatic channels that we back down from our support of the Egyptians. Doing so will harm the influence we have gained in Egypt, but if we do nothing we risk retaliation from the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
