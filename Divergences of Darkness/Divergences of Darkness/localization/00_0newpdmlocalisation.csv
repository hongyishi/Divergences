the_white_mans_burden_desc;'The White Man's Burden' was a poem by the English poet Rudyard Kipling, published in 1899. At face value it appeared to be a rhetorical command to white men to colonise and rule other nations for the benefit of those people (both the people and the duty may be seen as representing the 'burden' of the title), even though it mixed its  exhortation to empire with somber warnings of the costs involved in imperialism. Imperialists came to understand the phrase 'white man's burden' as a characterization for imperialism that justified the policy as a noble enterprise.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
