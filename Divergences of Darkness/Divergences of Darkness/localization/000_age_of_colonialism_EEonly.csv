EVTNAME140001;An Inconvenient Preacher;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME140001_sub;Problems from the Pulpit in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC140001;A prominent pacifist preacher in $STATENAME$ has been arguing against the government taking any steps to bolster our nation's military. He has decried any type of military action aside from self-defense. We could silence him permanently, but such a move would spread unrest in the state and infuriate the clergy.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTA140001;He can't preach from the grave.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB140001;Perhaps violence is not the answer.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC140001;Discredit the preacher, and hopefully reduce the impact of his message.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

EVTNAME140101_sub;Saber Rattling in $STATENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC140101;A decorated and high-ranking officer in $STATENAME$ has started to complain in public regarding his perceived lack of proper arms and supplies allocated to the military. He mingles his complaints with reminiscences of national glory and personal valor on far away battlefields. His voice carries great weight in both the military and general public. If we let him continue the state will undoubtedly become more jingoistic.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA140101;Force him into early retirement;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB140101;If there's one thing we need more of it is surely more guns;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME140201;Trouble in the Tavern;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME140201_sub;Barfight Turned Bloody;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC140201;A group of young officers in the state of $STATENAME$ have started a barfight over a prostitute in a local tavern and proceeded to kill three lower class workers. A sham trial in a military court has found all the officers innocent and the lower classes are infuriated. If we put them up for re-trial in a civil court the lower classes will be appeased but the image of the military will be hurt.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA140201;There is no need for a second trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB140201;Justice demands a re-trial.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME140301;The Barracks from Hell;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME140301_sub;Wretched Conditions for our Soldiers;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC140301;The deplorable conditions of a barracks in $STATENAME$ has become the subject of a widely read local newspaper. Maggot infested and rotten food along with faulty arms and ammunition has led to numerous injuries and outbreaks of disease. The barracks is supplied by a highly connected group of aristocrats and capitalists who are pressuring the government to ignore the matter, doing so will greatly upset the local soldiers. If we launch an official investigation the public will surely demand greater spending and oversight for military supply.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTA140301;We cannot allow this to continue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

EVTNAME140401_sub;Labourers Petition the Government;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC140401;A major mine in $STATENAME$ has been running at a deficit for some time now and the owners are on the verge of bankruptcy. The labourers at the mine are unable to find alternative work and fear for their livelihoods. We could step in and subsidize or nationalize the mine but doing so will create greater expectations among the lower classes for intervention in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA140401;The government has no role to play here.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB140401;Subsidize the mine.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

EVTNAME140501;Hands-Off Professor;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME140501_sub;Laissez-faire Sentiments;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC140501;A highly respected university professor has written an increasingly influential theory supporting a laissez-faire economic policy. His theory has gained many supporters from the artisans of the state who feel threatened by government ties to factory owners. Through our contacts we have learned that this man is a secret homosexual. We could use this against him publically but doing so will anger the artisans and atheists of the state.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA140501;His private affairs are none of our business.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB140501;Contact a newspaper immediately.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTC140501;Throw him in jail for deviant behavior.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME140601;Wretched Craftsmen;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME140601_sub;Workers in Woe;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC140601;Many of the factory workers in $STATENAME$ live a tragic life. Miserable and dejected," these poor souls are unable to fulfill even the most basic life needs. Among their flimsy shanties and squalid alleys a champion has risen among them. He preaches a new system to the hopeless masses in which every willing man and woman has a job and is provided for. A system in which the rich do not prey upon the weak. Factory workers across the state are heeding his words and the capitalists are fearful of the consequences. We could arrange an ""accident"" during his shift but that will cause great unrest among the workers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,,,
EVTOPTA140601;His next shift will be his last.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB140601;Their opinions matter not.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME140701;Evil at the Altar;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME140701_sub;There's Something Rotten in the Choir;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC140701;A dark and terrible secret has been brooding among the clergy in $STATENAME$. Whispers in dark corners speak of a deranged priest molesting young children. This pedophile has gone unchecked for quite some time while the rest of the clergy maintained disbelief. Now he is being shuffled about, moved from one parish to another, in order to cover up the story and secure the church's reputation. Rumours of his existence are spreading throughout the populace and the church is begging us to let them handle the matter. They claim that a public hearing would cause their flock to lose faith.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTA140701;If the church will not provide justice, the state gallows will.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTB140701;This is a great evil, but the faithful must not fall into unholy disbelief.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTNAME140801;Tensions in the Graveyard;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME140801_sub;Corpses Recourses;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC140801;One of the larger places of worship for our predominant faith in $STATENAME$ has started construction on an expansion. The construction workers have discovered a previously unknown graveyard on the expansion's land that houses the dead of a religious minority. The minority's leaders have insisted that the government halt the expansion. Doing so will appease the minority, but the clergy and moralists will be upset that a chance to put our faith forcefully above all others was missed, especially since the ground has already been consecrated.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTA140801;Corpses make excellent foundations.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB140801;We will respect their ancestors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME140901;Tablets at the Courthouse;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME140901_sub;Engravings Causing Ravings;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC140901;In order to emphasize the multi-religious makeup of $STATENAME$ and the law's relationship with the divine, a courthouse in $STATENAME$ has taken upon itself to install a series of reliefs along its walls detailing great lawbringers from various faiths. The placement of such large and overtly religious carvings has caused a fiery debate to break out between those advocating a seperatation of religion and state and those who applaud the addition of pluralistic religious ideals to the courthouse. With whom shall we side?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,
EVTOPTA140901;Smash the reliefs into little bits.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB140901;You shall not call religion to the bench.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME141001;Alleyway Brutality;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME141001_sub;Minorities Under Attack;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC141001;A teenage girl was found beaten and raped in a cultural minority's section of a city in $STATENAME$. Since the authorities have no leads, members of our primary culture have taken it upon themselves to seek retribution on the minority and anti-minority sentiments are becoming widespread. The local government has turned a blind eye to the whole matter and let the attacks of retribution be carried out. Many people in $STATENAME$ are now calling for severe restrictions to be placed upon the minorities in the nation. Bringing the retribution-seeking attackers to justice probably will not abate the anti-minority sentiments. However, we could falsify an investigation into the rape and claim it was in fact not committed by a minority.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTA141001;Let the bigotry flow high and wide.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB141001;Bring the retribution-seekers to justice.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

EVTNAME141101_sub;My Four Walls and Nobody Else's;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC141101;Minorities in $STATENAME$ are starting to gather and protest over the right to own property. Dishonest landowners in the state have repeatedly abused the minorities by collecting rent and then evicting them on false charges. The minorities have little legal recourse as their rights are almost non-existant. Recently, a family of immigrants who were wrongfully evicted from their residence died from exposure during an extremely cold night. Newspapers have picked up the story and are inflaming public opinion against our residency laws. We could let the anti-residency sentiments grow," or we could pay off some newspapers to run an opposing story detailing the ""uncouth and devious"" nature of the minority's culture.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x",,,,,
EVTOPTA141101;These people are humans and they deserve rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB141101;Run the counter-story and keep them repressed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

EVTNAME141201_sub;The Minority Vote;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC141201;Minorities in $STATENAME$ have gradually lifted themselves out of poverty and into the middle class. They have started their own sports organizations, newspapers, and religious centers. A particularly racist and sharply divided town in $STATENAME$ has voted in a series of laws that effectively bans a large minority's most important cultural festival. The laws probably would not have garnered enough votes if cultural minorities were allowed to vote. The debate about spreading full citizenship to minorities is raging among the state's newspapers and those in favor of full citizenship seem to be gaining the most sympathy. To stop this movement we could stage an arson attack on the racist town's city hall and make it look like the minority was behind it.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTA141201;Framing an arson attack on minorities? Brilliant.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB141201;Let the debate take its course.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME141301;Foreign Goods;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME141301_sub;Made in Where?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC141301;Artisans in $STATENAME$ fear for their livelihoods. In every stall in every market there seems to be more and more goods stocked from abroad. The artisans have started a public campaign to sway the rest of the population towards protectionism. Their rallying cry is simple and blunt: 'our nation, our markets, and our goods'. We could launch a public relations campaign detailing the importance of free trade to our export industry but such a move will disgruntle our artisans.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTOPTA141301;Launch the counter-campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB141301;Our nation, our markets, and our goods indeed.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME141401;An Open Market;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME141401_sub;Factories Push for Free Trade;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC141401;An association of capitalists in $STATENAME$ have begun a public relations campaign educating their workers on the value of free trade. They have quite successfully persuaded the clerks and craftsmen of the state that free trade is in their and the factories' best interest. The free trade campaign has begun to make an impact on the population as a whole. We could launch a counter campaign emphasizing the necessity of protectionism to many facets of our economy but that would greatly upset the capitalists.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTA141401;Launch the counter campaign.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB141401;Free trade is the path to prosperity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTNAME999000;National Debate: Trade Policy;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999000;The intensive election campaign has reached the boiling point in $COUNTRY$, where a fierce trade policy debate pits the friends of free trade against the pals of protectionism in a rough rumble-and-tumble to determine the future of our nation's traders. Free-traders argue that goods must be allowed to freely cross all borders, while protectionists argue that our nation's fragile industries need protection from dangerous foreign competition threatening to undo them. Which path will $COUNTRY$ tread, as it decides on: Free trade, or Protectionism?;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTOPTA999000;Our trade must be protected from destructive foreign competition!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTOPTB999000;Let the debate take its own course, and let the chips fall where they may!;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

EVTDESC999002;'The morality and virtue of our people have started to decline!' This statement caused much stir among the debaters of toleration and religious plurality. They have started to question the country's view on religion.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,

EVTDESC999003;Two debaters are arguing heatedly about their views. The rest of the hall sits dumbfounded when words like aliens, minorities, ethnic and cultural groups are thrown between the two. One wish that immigrants should adapt to the dominant culture while the other believes that they should retain their cultural heritage.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

EVTDESC999020;The remaining election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually quiet. The political parties have had no pressing issues which have gripped the country's attention,  and the election seems to be passing without any national debates or events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,

EVTNAME999021;Violent Elections;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,,,
EVTDESC999021;The election campaign of $YEAR$ has been unusually violent. Only a few days after the campaign had begun, the first incidents started. Strikes occured in several large factories, with incidents of streetfighting in most major cities. Paramilitary groups have threatened voters of opposing ideologies, while radicals have staged attacks on political enemies. The $COUNTRY_ADJ$ police are tirelessly to get the situation under control, but it looks as if $COUNTRY$ is in for a contentious election.;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
