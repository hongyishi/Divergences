EVTDESC36215_NEW;Porto Alegre is under Brazilian control once again. The gauchos, however, have promised to continue their rebellion against what they consider unfair rule from the throne. It may prove difficult in the coming years to keep the region calm.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME60121;Joining the Greater Union;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC60121;Since the revolution, the $COUNTRY_ADJ$ government has awaited a contender who could unite $CULTURE_GROUP_UNION$. Now that such a nation has arisen, many feel it is time to surrender our personal sovereignty towards the $UNION_ADJ$ cause.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME90038;The Pact of Plombières;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC90038;We have been approached by a Sardinian envoy, the Count of Cavour, who has made an interesting proposal: an alliance to make war against Austria, gaining Sardinia the Austrian-held provinces of Lombardy. In exchange, Sardinia would hand over Savoy and Nice to France. It is an interesting idea, and one that allows France to take a role that would not paint us as the aggressors. Shall we agree?;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME90040;The Sepoy Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC90040;A mutiny by a group of sepoys in the service of the British East India company has ignited lingering resentment amongst our Indian subjects into open resistance against our rule. Should this grow out of hand, all of our holdings in British India could be in jeopardy.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTDESC90039;$MONARCHTITLE$, the ambassador from Sardinia-Piedmont has approached us with the suggestion of a pan-Italian alliance to retake the lost northern lands from Austria. A dangerous proposition, to be sure.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTNAME95026;Liberian Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

EVTDESC95076;A spontaneous protest by young Poles against conscription into the Russian Army has quickly erupted into a widespread insurrection, supported by high-ranking Polish and Lithuanian officers and politicians. The eyes of all of Europe are upon us, and if we deal with the insurgents too harshly it may hurt our relations with European powers. If we do not, however, the uprising may spread even further.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,
EVTNAME95085;The Finnish Question;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC95085;With the recent unrest in Finnish lands, the local Finland government has demanded greater autonomy from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Failure to provide it will only lead to further ethnic unrest.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

EVTNAME95250;The White Rajah;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC95250;Brunei's control over the southern regions has only ever been nominal, and the region has been self-governed under the Sultan of Sarawak. During a recent crisis, an Englishman by the name of James Brooke provided the Sultan invaluable assistance in restoring order, and has been bestowed with the title of governor. This 'White Rajah' is now effectively the ruler, and is seeking alliance with Brunei. We must either recognize the independence of an area we only barely controlled, or seek to assert our authority and perhaps anger the English in the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME95251;The Dutch East Indies;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC95251;The Dutch East India Company has been slowly spreading its influence within the East Indies, and is urging our government to establish protectorates over the remaining sultanates on the islands.

EVTNAME96100;The Arab Revolt;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC96100;A wave of nationalism has begun to spread among the Mashriqi, fueled by their resentment over $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule. Our governors in the region are understandably nervous, and report that we can expect major rebellions in the coming years unless we are very careful.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTNAME96120;The House of Rashid;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

EVTNAME96165;Italian Unification;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC96165;The Italians have managed to unify at long last, threatening $COUNTRY_ADJ$ interests in the region. We will have to decide whether it is in our best interests to object or to make friends with the new rulers. What has been done cannot now be undone, after all, and a united Italy could be a formidable enemy or a powerful $COUNTRY_ADJ$ ally.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME96170;Il Risorgimento;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC96170;$COUNTRY$ has become the center of Italian nationalism, its people calling out for unification. Italian flags are flying in the streets of $CAPITAL$, and we must decide if we wish to support this call and bring all of Italy peacefully under our banner. If we refuse, our people will be upset... and it's unlikely the opportunity will arise again.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME160001;The Taiping Rebellion;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC160001;The followers of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' have finally risen in rebellion against Imperial rule. A peasant army has been organized by the rebels Feng Yunshan and Wei Changhui, followers of Hong Xiuquan, and have actually managed to defeat the Imperial garrisons and drive out the local governors. These Christians are driven to topple the Qing Dynasty and led by a madman... we must act quickly, before this rebellion succeeds and proves to the rest of China that the Mandate of Heaven no longer rests with the Manchu.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,

EVTDESC160002;We have crushed the 'Heavenly Kingdom', and proven to all of China that the Qing Dynasty yet maintains the Mandate of Heaven. We will abide no more insurrections.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTNAME160003;Taiping Rebellion Victorious;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC160003;Even though we are not yet done with the 'Heavenly Kingdom', the fact the rebels have forced us to a ceasefire and have not been crushed is being taken by our Chinese subjects as a sign of weakness. Officials are predicting rebellions in many other places in the years to come.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTNAME160011;The Female Shortage;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC160011;Due to the low value assigned to the birth of daughters, female infanticide has become wide-spread across much of China. The practice has become so common, in fact, it has led to a shortage of women.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME160501;Missionaries in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC160501;Christian missionaries are stirring up trouble in southern China, handing out pamphlets in an effort to gain converts. This would not be so objectionable were the pamphlet not also preaching sedition against the Qing Dynasty. The fact that so many in $PROVINCENAME$ are willing to listen to these fools is worrying.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
EVTNAME160502;Anti-Manchu Sentiment;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC160502;To many people in China, the Qing Dynasty is seen as ineffective and corrupt, ruled by Manchu foreigners. Bitter hatred has been stirring, particularly in the south.

EVTDESC164503;A troublemaker has arisen in the southern lands. According to reports, this man claims to have received a vision to the effect that he is the younger brother of Jesus Christ and was sent to rid China of the corrupt Manchu Qing Dynasty rulers. He has been winning converts to Christianity, and it seems there are many willing to listen to his words of sedition and join his so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME164504;Hong Xiuquan;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC164504;The man behind the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom' has been given a name: Hong Xiuquan. A former farmer who attempted the civil service examinations in Guangzhou and failed, he has now become a charismatic visionary taking advantage of anti-Manchu sentiment in the south. Some say he is crazed and mad, but regardless he is a danger to the Qing Dynasty and his words are finding eager ears.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME164505;Yang Xiuqing;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC164505;Reports have arrived at the palace that a firewood seller has taken to walking the Southlands, claiming to speak with the voice of God. Regardless of his seeming madness, the man has proven very effective at spreading the word of the so-called 'Heavenly Kingdom'.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,

EVTDESC800055;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ goverment has been overthrown, and the rebel government has declared themselves free from $COUNTRY_ADJ$ rule.

EVTNAME800056;Rebellion in our ally!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC800056;The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government has been toppled, and the rebels blame $COUNTRY_ADJ$ influence as one of the primary causes of the old regime's corruption.

EVTNAME800060;The Proletariat Cause;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC800060;An opportunity has arisen to fund the spread of communism in a neighboring state.

EVTNAME800064;We Were Discovered;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC800064; Several of our agents in $FROMCOUNTRY$ were discovered and interrogated, and word of our efforts have spread. This will have an impact on our infamy, and the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ may choose to take the issue as cause for war against us.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME800065;Diplomatic Incident;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC800065;We have reports of $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ propaganda being spread in one of our border provinces. Clearly the $FROMCOUNTRY$ government does not respect our sovereignty.
