force_vassal_freedom_title;We Shall Be Free;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
force_vassal_freedom_desc;A chance is upon us. Do we approach the great power who has so much influence in $COUNTRY$, and ask them to intervene in our affairs? If we do, we stand a chance of freeing ourselves from foreign rule. We also stand to lose a great deal, as do they. We must proceed cautiously.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
no_freedom;Attempted Freedom;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
no_freedom_desc;We attempted to free ourselves from foreign rule. We must wait until there is another opportunity, as for now they are watching us closely.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,

EVTNAME800012;Intervention in $FROMCOUNTRY$?;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC800012;We have been secretly approached by certain members within the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government, suggesting that $COUNTRY_ADJ$ intervention to free them from foreign control might be in both our interests. $FROMCOUNTRY$ would be free to seek its own destiny, while $COUNTRY$ would gain an ally. The catch, of course, is that the attempt could look like interference to the rest of the world... and earn us the enmity of $FROMCOUNTRY$'s rulers in particular. If we make the attempt, we should learn of the results within a week at the most.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME800013;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC800013;A foreign power has meddled in the affairs of $FROMCOUNTRY$, taking advantage of the unrest there to engineer a coup which has freed them from our control. Our trusted servants in that nation have been either arrested or expelled, and now the world watches for our response.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME800014;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Declares Independence;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,

EVTNAME800015;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Refuses to Intervene;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC800015;The answer from $FROMCOUNTRY$ is clear: they won't intervene in our internal affairs. We are on our own.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTNAME800016;Intervention Failed;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC800016;$FROMCOUNTRY$ attempted to intervene, but the resulting orgy of violence in $CAPITAL$ has failed to drive out the influence of our overlord. Worse, it has resulted in $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ being greatly damaged, as many see them as instigators rather than would-be liberators.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME800017;Free At Great Cost;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC800017;$FROMCOUNTRY$ has supported the coud d'etat in $CAPITAL$, but with the change came an orgy of violence that has seen $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ influence in $COUNTRY$ damaged along with that of our overlord. Many people in $COUNTRY$ are left with hard feelings, and see $FROMCOUNTRY$ as an instigator rather than a liberator. What will come next depends entirely on whether reprisals will come our way.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME800018;Free At Last!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC800018;$FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ intervention has succeeded in freeing our government from foreign rule. After an orgy of violence in $CAPITAL$, citizens are celebrating in the streets. $COUNTRY$ has a new destiny as a truly independent nation... provided no reprisals come out way, of course.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME800021;Attempted Coup in $FROMCOUNTRY$;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC800021;A foreign power attempted to use their influence in $FROMCOUNTRY$ to take advantage of the unrest there and free them from our control. Their efforts have come to naught, and their agents have been arrested and many of the $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ malcontents exposed and imprisoned. The question remains, however, as to what we will do in response to this outrage.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,
EVTNAME800022;Attempt Thwarted;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC800022;Our attempt to interfere in $FROMCOUNTRY$'s government was thwarted. We have lost influence there, and angered their overlord. This may lead to war, but we will have to wait and see what develops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME800023;$FROMCOUNTRY$ Freed At Great Cost;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC800023;Our attempt to engineer a coup in $FROMCOUNTRY$ was successful, but at the cost of a great deal of our influence there. The $FROMCOUNTRY_ADJ$ government is angry, and it's possible their overlords may attempt to retaliate either against them or against us. We will have to wait and see what develops of this.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,
EVTNAME800024;$FROMCOUNTRY$ is Free!;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,,
EVTDESC800024;Our attempt to engineer a coup in $FROMCOUNTRY$ was successful, and they are now an independent country as well as a useful ally. It's possible their overlords may attempt to retaliate either against them or against us. We shall have to wait and see what develops.;;;;;;;;;;;;x,,,,
