EVTNAME67500;Turmoil in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC67500;$PROVINCENAME$ has been recently been brought into $COUNTRY_ADJ$ control, and the region is currently in turmoil over the change. Looting and other crimes are commonplace and there is some resistance to our rule. Until we can gain control of the situation and finally integrate the province, it will be less productive. Placing troops in the vicinity should help bring the province under control.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA67500;Assuming Direct Control!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME67502;Resistance in $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC67502;The turmoil in $PROVINCENAME$ is over and control has been established, however the locals are resisting our rule. Violent resistance isn't our only problem, passive resistance is catching on, with workers staying home. Improving the locals opinion of us as well as a policy of full citizenship should help smooth the transition.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA67502;Damn.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME67503;Integrating $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC67503;With the recent problems in $PROVINCENAME$ over we can begin with the integration of $PROVINCENAME$ into our grand nation. Without the proper infrastructure our administration is suffering, and alas there isn't much we can do to speed up the process.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA67503;Well get a move on!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME67505;Integrated $PROVINCENAME$;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC67505;The infrastructure in $PROVINCENAME$ has been established and all thats left is to wait for the locals to accept their fate and for the international community to accept our rule as legitimate.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA67505;It's only a matter of time now.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME67506;$PROVINCENAME$ Rule Legitimized;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC67506;The international community has accepted that we now control $PROVINCENAME$ and our rule is considered legitimate. The people have grown to feel as though they are a part our grand nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA67506;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME67507;$PROVINCENAME$ Already Legitimate;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC67507;The international community has realized that our rule of $PROVINCENAME$ is legitimate. These are our people.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA67507;Finally!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTNAME67510;Unrecognized Possessions;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTDESC67510;All provinces with unrecognized claims have begun being integrated into our nation.;;;;;;;;;;;;x
EVTOPTA67510;Great!;;;;;;;;;;;;x
